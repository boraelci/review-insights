0,"October 7, 2020",4.0,Only works on Apple Products,  Doesn't work on any Bluetooth phone. I got it for my iPad and my phone.
1,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Great stuff,  These work great with my I phone and good delivery as well
2,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Very good!,  Cane is the box very good
3,"October 7, 2020",2.0,Not new,  Opened it for the first time and Bluetooth’d to my daughters phone and it says “daddy’s AirPods”These were told they would be new.... they obviously aren’t.
4,"October 7, 2020",4.0,How they work,  my left airpod kept getting low so i returned em & got new ones but my left one still low asf but they ight tho
5,"October 7, 2020",1.0,I got bad Apple ear pods.,"  My right ear plug stopped working and charging too . I really have no use for them now, so what do I do with them, just stare at them. I thought I had a warranty on them but nobody is helping me so HELP"
6,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Great earbuds,"  Purchased AirPods for my wife, she really likes them a lot and I got them at a great price thanks to Amazon Warehouse.  The sound quality is adequate for the design, depending on the sound quality you are looking for may want to step up to the pro model or check out the Powerbeat Pros as an alternative.  Overall we are happy with the purchase."
7,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Handy to be wireless,"  It's great to cut the wires, welcome to 2020."
8,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  Good quality
9,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,  Love them I use them every day!
10,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Great buy!!!,  I loved it and I will buy again
11,"October 7, 2020",2.0,Stopped working after 7 months,"  I got these Airpods in late March 2020. I went to use them today, Oct 2020, to make a call and my cell was not connecting. I've shutdown my cell, plugged the Airpod cord to another outlet, pushed the button on the back of the airpod case, and tried to connect with another cell phone and nothing worked. The light on the case never would come on. I keep the case plugged in most of the time and it's generally charging every day. Now, I'm going to have to find an apple store so they can see if it's defected. I would be livid if I lived in a small town that had no apple store. Hopefully, my experience with this at the store will be a good one as it's been less than a year since I've purchased these."
12,"October 6, 2020",5.0,I love them,  I love them
13,"October 6, 2020",4.0,Stay in my ears,"  Earbuds with the rubber tips have never fit my ears very well — they either fall out easily or hurt after a while. But Apple’s wired earbuds have always fit way better for me, and the same is true of the AirPods! The sound quality is good enough for listening to music or watching a tv show. I wouldn’t do music production or sound mixing with them, but that’s not really what these are for anyway.The new IOS 14 update makes these MUCH more convenient. When switching between my iPad and iPhone, the airpods seamlessly switch over automatically."
14,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Perfect and I don’t say that about anything,"  These things are sooooo money. Sound great, don’t fall out and look cool. Don’t even look at others your just wasting time that you could be listening to you tunes. Buy it"
15,"October 6, 2020",5.0,"YES THEY ARE 1st GEN, but they are still great!","  I bought these to use at work instead of my over the ear beats because wearing those huge headphones isn’t a great look at work. I wasn’t expecting them to sound amazing, but the sound quality is comparable to my beats that were 3x the price. They are definitely by apple; I’ve watched enough YouTube videos to be able to spot fakes. Mine are definitely 1st gen. This is how you can tell:If the picture on the back of the box includes the charger, it is 1st gen. The 2nd gen AirPod box doesn’t feature a picture of the charging cable on the back; all you’d see are the AirPods in their case. The 2nd gen case also has a tiny little dot on the front, a light that turns on when the case is charging wirelessly. The 1st gen case does not have that feature, so, of course, there’s no light on the front.But seriously, that’s the only feature you’re missing out on, other than maybe some better sound quality that you won’t really miss unless you’ve used 2nd gens before. Again, these are really great."
16,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Good sound quality and long battery life,"  The sound quality is very good, and I am also very satisfied with the battery life of the product so far. I wanted to order it for a long time but didn’t want to spend so much money on it, but at the end I didn’t regret buying it, I am extremely happy with my purchase"
17,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Love them!,  my daughter loves her new airpods.  hands free calling and the call quality is very good.
18,"October 6, 2020",2.0,Didn't Last,"  I'm not sure why, but my son's AirPods within 6 months lost their battery life and one of the sides stopped working.  Wish I could return them for a different pair."
19,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Do it for the meme,  Can't hear broke now
20,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Worth the price,"  work great and are really comfortable to my ears. Aesthetically, they look great to me."
21,"October 6, 2020",1.0,Airpods wont connect together after 6 months,  These sounded and worked great for about 6 months. Now they both wont connect at the same time. I’ve done all the troubleshooting to restart the AirPods and nothing will get them to work at the same time. Bummer.
22,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Be careful don’t loose them,  Love them
23,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  My son loves his airpods.
24,"October 6, 2020",5.0,10/10 Recommend,  I absolutely love my AirPods.
25,"October 6, 2020",1.0,Disappointed,  Only one earphone works
26,"October 6, 2020",5.0,Awesome product,  Excellent quality. Very pleased.
27,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Love it
28,"October 5, 2020",5.0,They are awesome; also everyone including thier grandmother has a pair,  See headline lol
29,"October 5, 2020",1.0,mistaken,  I did not realize that this product was made by Apple. Very disappointed. Would not purchase again.
30,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Love them,"  I really enjoy these. I was so worried about them falling out my ear but they actually don’t, I love that when I take them out of my ear the music stops. These are just the most convenient earbuds ever."
31,"October 5, 2020",5.0,"Quality sound, low quality noise cancellation.",  Sound quality is on point. These are not great at noise canceling. The extended battery life is very helpful.
32,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Long lasting battery life,  Sound quality is great. I love using these when I facetime because I can hear the other person so much better. Also the battery life is much better than I expected.
33,"October 5, 2020",4.0,Amazing product,"  Amazing product, the sound quality is very good. I had airpods before but they were around 2-3 years old and the battery died very very fast! bought these and the battery has been doing good so far. Also the volume is very loud!"
34,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Legitimate. Does everything it's supposed to.,  They're genuine apple airpods (Go on Apple.com / Serial Number Check) to verify they're legitimate when you get them.Sidenote: The Case Lid is the one that's supposed to match the Serial number on the box. Each apple airpod has a differing serial number on the pod itself.Arrived within one day brand spankin' new. Highly recommend. It feels great to cut the cord and be truly wireless especially when paired with an apple watch!
35,"October 5, 2020",5.0,very fast shipping!,  great product!
36,"October 5, 2020",1.0,Garbage,  These are terrible. Overpriced for nothing. Regularly have problems with it. Had them replaced several times. Then apple refuses to fix them. Just want you to buy their more expensive higher product.
37,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great
38,"October 5, 2020",4.0,Good quality,"  Great sound quality, easy to connect Bluetooth. Just wish it had a longer battery life."
39,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Buenos deseos,  Me agrado
40,"October 5, 2020",5.0,My favorite,"  I love the air pods. They’re so much better than any other earbuds I’ve tried to date. They are loud, noise cancellation is perfect and other people hear me clearly when speaking on calls. Absolutely love them."
41,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Their Apple they better work,"  There are several AirPods on the market and I have tried a couple .. I have had zero success.  Be cause I have had zero success, I made the investment into Apples AirPods ..  do they have exceptional sound for music .. sort of but they work and that’s what I need."
42,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Good,  Great price
43,"October 5, 2020",1.0,Stopped working after 2 weeks,  They were great at first but now they aren’t working. I’ve had them for only two weeks and they won’t reconnect to my phone. We even tried connecting them to my husbands phone but it only makes a static noise in the headphones. Super unfortunate that I wasted my money
44,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Very easy connecting to different devices.  Sound quality is great.  Worth the price.
45,"October 5, 2020",3.0,Sounds great when they’re working.,"  They sound good, when both AirPods work! Put them in, the left one doesn’t work - I unpair them from my phone and reset them and they’re fine until I use them again and the right one doesn’t work. Then I go through the process again. I bought them in August of this year. Very disappointed."
46,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Great and are a genuine apple product,"  I loved it, easy to set up and use, highly recommend!"
47,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Full marks,  Full marks
48,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Would recommend,  I was very hesitant to purchase these due to price. I ended up caving. I’ve owned them for several months and I am so glad I finally bought them. The battery lasts a very long time. Sound quality is great. I love them.
49,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  This was a must have product for my teenager, but we loved getting these for such a great deal!  Great product with great sound quality!"
50,"October 5, 2020",1.0,DON'T waste your $ on Apple,"  Item is 3 months old.  Both will not play simultaneously.  I am tech savvy, went through all the trouble shooting instructions.  Wasted my time calling Apple.  Unbelievable that they will not replace item without your credit card on hold for the returned defective item.  My other son bought Jaybird's - not one issue!!!"
51,"October 5, 2020",5.0,"Gnarly sound, love the pause feature!","  I’m pretty in love wit these pups! I have a few pair of beats, and my husband ordered these for me because he bought himself something without letting me know. I told him I’d probably return them. I decided to keep them because they have killer sound, and I feel super high speed walking around with air pods. I really love how you take one out, and it pauses whatever you’re doing. I’m a huge podcast listener, it’s nice to automatically have it paused so I’m not missing out on true crime goodness! AirPods are kind of a game changer!"
52,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Authentic & just as described
53,"October 5, 2020",5.0,Love them <3,  i bought 2 pair and love them soo much 1 one was a gift and the  other was for me
54,"October 4, 2020",5.0,convenient & great quality,  these work so great & its so much better than wired headphones. i seriously love these. theyre vey convenient & discreet. the sound quality is amazing. the charging case holds a charge for so long & i can go days without having to charge it. airpods die within a few hours but all you have to do is pop them back in the case for a little & youre good to go. its very much worth the price. ditch your wired headphones asap
55,"October 4, 2020",5.0,great buy,  great investment! love my airpods! 10/10
56,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Sound quality.,  Stays charged really well and connects easily.
57,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Amazing battery life and sound quality!!!,  They’re great! I honestly use them all the time and yet they seem to never run out of battery. The sound quality is amazing and I love how fast they connect after you put them in your ears.
58,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Good,  Overall good
59,"October 4, 2020",5.0,"Easy to wear, great sound for the wearer, no sound for those close by.","  I love these air pods!  I use them mainly to listen to books at night when I go to bed.  My husband is happy I no longer have the light on for an hour or so.  He can’t hear anything from the air pods as I use them, the light is out, he’s a happy guy!"
60,"October 4, 2020",1.0,Garbage don’t buy from here,  Stopped charging after a few uses.
61,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Good. Would recommend,  Literally just apple airpods. Good sound quality and pairs nicely. Had them for over 6 months now and still in great shape both visually and sound quality wise
62,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Best Purchase,  Best purchase! Great for an active life style I’d you don’t want annoying cords! Delivery was super nice too they made sure I got them at the door so no one would steal them and there was a warning on the box to make sure it wasn’t in any extreme temperature.
63,"October 4, 2020",5.0,love,"  i love these AirPods. I didnt see the point in dropping money to buy the new gen airpods, so i just got these. they're great!"
64,"October 4, 2020",1.0,Unhappy customer,"  I bought the AirPods on Aug 12. I do not use them often, I purchased them for my second job. I clean an office once a week. One of of them have already quit working!! It hasn't even been 2 months and have used them a handful of times! I should get better life out of them 😡"
65,"October 4, 2020",4.0,Clear,"  This product is very easy to use, the sound is clear, it is worth having."
66,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Great for video calls,"  Great for music and video calls, but battery dies after all day calls."
67,"October 4, 2020",4.0,Great,  They cut in and out after a months of usage.
68,"October 4, 2020",5.0,Bueno,  Llegaron bien
69,"October 4, 2020",4.0,Great,  They are great. I have a hard time with controls on the earbuds themselves. They dont seem as responsive.
70,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Never die on me.,"  Regular apple airpods, just as you’d expect. They sound perfect after a few months of use so far"
71,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Game-changer,"  I didn’t know what I was missing!  I walk a couple of miles each morning and had been using corded earbuds, which I all too often would accidentally catch my hand on, or not have enough length to carry my phone in a pocket.  These eliminated those issues.  I am also working remotely and have several ZOOM meetings a week.  I have started using the Air Pods for those as well.  They’re great for working in the yard without having to keep phone in hand or pocket.  Sound is very good.  Charge time is as advertised and recharge time is quick."
72,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Couldn’t have asked for better ❤️
73,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Authentic Apple,"  We considered buying a knockoff brand, but we ended up going with the real deal and so glad we did. You cannot go wrong with Apple. Great products, always! This is definitely an authentic product."
74,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Overall,  They work how they supposed to work!
75,"October 3, 2020",4.0,WORKS GREAT,  MUSIC & PHONE CALLS WATCHING VIDEO’S
76,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Value for your money,  Am in love
77,"October 3, 2020",3.0,A little noise,"  The sound quality is average, there are a little bit noise, ears will hurt after wear a long time"
78,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Excellent Sound Quality,  I spend a lot of time on the phone for work - and I like how I can walk away from my phone but continue in my conversation.  It's SO helpful for multi-tasking.  I do wish the battery life lasted longer though.
79,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Overall good product and delivery process along with the early delivery!,  I give this product two thumbs up 👍.the overall delivery was amazing and in such a timely manner. My package was definitely early which is awesome ! I’m passing the word. Keep up the good work .
80,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Good Quality,  I love my Airpods! The sound quality and noise cancellation are great and the battery lasts a long time. I can go a pretty long time without having to charge them.
81,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Better than I would have ever expected!!!,"  I really can’t say enough good things about these AirPods. I have purchased the “knock off” brands that look similar and have had multiple problems with them. I was a little hesitant in spending the extra cash... compared to the $30 “knock offs”.  But after opening the box the AirPods, they immediately were recognized by mu iPhone. The sound quality was probably the best I have ever experienced with earbuds. I think they are better than a pair of Bose that I used to use... These are the real deal.. The size of the case is smaller and feels very well constructed. Like I said... I am completely satisfied and would recommend.. do not waste your time on the “knock off” brands... Go for the AirPods!!!ThanksJay"
82,"October 3, 2020",1.0,Defective,  Defective never worked
83,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Love apple products,  Love the headset. I do not care for those that plug into my ear canal so these are so much better and comfortable to me. The sound it great.There is an occasional issue with the connection to my phone which means that I have to put them back in the case and take them back out to reset the connection and that seems to work very well.  I have even used them as the microphone to record video.  I love the set an use them so much I have to remember to charge them when not in use.  I believe it takes at least 3 - 5 hours on a call or listening to music or podcasts.Great product and I truly hope Apple does not stop making them incase I do need to replace them at some time.  I do not like the newer version as I said before.  I really do not like any headsets that plug into my ear canal.Great product and Highly recommended.
84,"October 3, 2020",3.0,If you suffer from migraines don’t get them,"  The sound quality is great. They charge extremely fast and the battery life is pretty good. However, they give me intense migraines."
85,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Work Great!,  Fast deliveryBought them for our Grandson he uses them all the time.
86,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Great sound quality,"  Bought these for my daughter and she loves them, great noise canceling sound"
87,"October 3, 2020",5.0,Review,"  I love my AirPods! I use them everyday, all day. The battery life is very good and it charges fairly quickly. The sound quality is fantastic! I have recommended two people  to these and they love theirs as well."
88,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Nice,"  Even when the Pro coming out, I still like this one better. Everything is perfect, the price is great. Only the shipment running late, that is the only thing I can complete about it."
89,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Producto original y sellado,"  Bien empaquetado, sellado y original. Buena calidad de audio y duración de batería"
90,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Muy prácticos y originales,"  La mejor inversión, Útil para ejercitarse sin incomodarse por los molestos cables, Vino en su caja original, perfectamente sellado."
91,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Muy buenos,"  No son fake, son orijinales, no se porque la jente comenta que son de mala calidad, me encantan😁😆🤩"
92,"October 2, 2020",4.0,good product but for me very uncomfortable,  good product but for me very uncomfortable
93,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Great value,  Great product good value
94,"October 2, 2020",5.0,no wires,  this is a quality product and a satisfyingly quality package. The buds fit fine and the case is simply magnificently wellwell designed and manufactured.  Don't stand over a storm drain and adjust the pods.
95,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Awsome,  Nothing
96,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Definitely worth every penny and then some,  I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.
97,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  They're great, worth every penny.  My only regret is that I didn't purchase them sooner.  What are you waiting for, buy them!"
98,"October 2, 2020",4.0,base model Apple Airpods,  Seem to be working fine.. battery life is OK.. don't expect to wear them all day without having to charge them again in the case. They fit my ears just fine buy my husband can't use them because they fall out of his all the time.
99,"October 2, 2020",4.0,Decent,"  These are pretty good, but sometimes they randomly disconnect from Bluetooth, turn off, or just stop playing music while being connected to Bluetooth. Battery and everything was perfect."
100,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Great airpods,  Perfect sound without the extra noise. Great battery life.
101,"October 2, 2020",5.0,I am very fond of,  I am very fond of
102,"October 2, 2020",1.0,Defective,  Right AirPod didn’t work. Complete waste of a purchase and terrible returning issues. Just get them from the Apple store
103,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Real airpods,  Was worried because I heard of people getting fake or used AirPods off Amazon but these were legit and awesome. Bought them for my husband and he uses them everyday. Also worth noting they have survived 2 trips in the washing machine and dryer and still work great lol
104,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Love the sound quality
105,"October 2, 2020",5.0,what I really use them for or wanted them for,  they work very well.  Except for being able to use them on older ipod and phone.  I have audio books on ipod and phone and they dont work on older products.
106,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Headphone.,"  These headphones are the best, If for some reason they brake or I loss them, I will be buying them again."
107,"October 2, 2020",4.0,Good headphones but not for all audiences.,"  He suffers from big headaches, I really don't think it's the airpods I think it's the technology behind it.and they are no longer just headaches, there are even some that cause mild nausea.  ... The question is no longer whether the Air boxes are the cause of these evils, but the radiation that can be associated with a device that is wireless and that is placed in an area very close to the brain."
108,"October 2, 2020",4.0,Great for listening and working out not for phone calls,  I bought these instead of the Pros. Worht it tbh. The only thing that i dont like is the microphone on them. If you wanna use them to try and talk to someone one the phone good luck.
109,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Great,  This was a great purchase. They are absolutely wonderful. I would buy another pair for my son.
110,"October 2, 2020",1.0,JUST BUY FROM APPLE,  My airpods barely lasted a month. They are constantly going out randomly not working. It sounds like the wiring inside is bad and the head phones just give out. Please don't waste your money and buy directly from apple!I wish I would have taken the reviews about these being fake more seriously because they probably are... Wish I could return!!!!!
111,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Great airpods:),"  Worked great, no issues!"
112,"October 2, 2020",4.0,Best to order with case when getting the AirPods,  Really happy 😊
113,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Great gift,  I got these as a gift and he says they work very well.
114,"October 2, 2020",1.0,Poor sound quality.,  Not what I thought they were. Other brands sound a lot better.
115,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Amazing product,  Really nice quality and the sound is great!
116,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Love these AirPods the best ones out there!,  Love these AirPods the best ones out there!
117,"October 2, 2020",5.0,Wish I would have bought them earlier!,  I use these daily for my cardio and love them! I’ve gotten so used to using them for work so I am hands free. Easy to connect and set up and sound is great!
118,"October 1, 2020",4.0,Good buy,  Definitely a good buy. They have worked great. I use them all the time. Only complaint is they did come a little dirty. The inside of the case had some dust and grime in it. I just cleaned the case really well and wiped down the pods. Love them.
119,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Very nice,  Very nice
120,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Feliz,  Excelente
121,"October 1, 2020",5.0,"Clear, light weight and good sound quality",  I was tired of wired earphones and bought this to attend my online classes with more concentration. Though they do not have noise cancellation but audio is really crisp and clear. Battery life in one go is enough to attend a 2.5 hrs session. Overall I am liking it as they are super light and doesn’t fall from years. Recommended for online classes and video calls.
122,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Good quality.!!,"  I love these headphones, The quality of the mic and audio are beyond what I was expecting. These actually turned out to be a very impressive set of headphones that I use daily."
123,"October 1, 2020",3.0,AIRPODS,  Nothing particularly special here. They work.
124,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Works as expected,  Works as expected
125,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Works great
126,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Working properly,  Love it!
127,"October 1, 2020",3.0,Not worth,  Ordered twice both the times recieved faulty charging case. Really disappointed with the product.
128,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Great job on my order,  My kid is very happy with her new air pods
129,"October 1, 2020",5.0,The Best,  These are by far the Best Pods to use with Iphone's. Don't waste money (like I have) on after-market brands. These do the job and are comfortable as well.
130,"October 1, 2020",5.0,What i was looking for,  Very good and reliable
131,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Great,  They were good as expected mine are as good as new and I ordered them around Christmas
132,"October 1, 2020",5.0,Dope,  So worth it the sound quality is crazy good
133,"September 30, 2020",1.0,Broke within 2 months,  My left earbud is out and cannot be fixed. SO disappointed in what happened since these are SO PRICY!
134,"September 30, 2020",5.0,Highly recommended!!!,  The sound is excellent!! Highly recommended.
135,"September 30, 2020",3.0,They fall out,  Great except the Left one falls out. Fell out getting into my car. Fell out multiple times as I ate dinner. I really wanted to like these but if I’m always afraid one will just fall out then what good are they?
136,"September 30, 2020",5.0,Real Apple Airpods at a decent price.,  I don't understand why there are reviews saying these are fake. They're the real deal. Nothing too fancy. A great deal for the 2nd gen Airpods. I like these better than the Airpod Pro. They fit my ear better and for $100 less the sound quality is almost exactly the same. At this price they're definitely worth the money.
137,"September 30, 2020",1.0,False Advertising - Version 1 NOT version 2,  I researched the specs and read the comments to make sure these were version 2 before I ordered them.  What I received was NOT version 2 but was the version 1.
138,"September 30, 2020",2.0,Not worth the price,  Don’t buy won’t last longer than a month.
139,"September 30, 2020",4.0,"Convenient, great sounds",  Loved it!
140,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  I love these!! I accidentally washed my AirPods and they worked perfectly fine. The sound is awesome!
141,"September 29, 2020",2.0,Unfortunate,  The left AirPod broke after one day of usage.
142,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Sooo convenient.,  Noise cancellation is only fair.
143,"September 29, 2020",5.0,airpod,  very good thank you amazon
144,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Lightweight and Comfortable,  Talking and listening to music.

147,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Nice Buds...,"  I like these air buds, the fit nicely, the battery life is very good...when working out side I can still hear what is going on based on the volume that I have chosen... I have been able to Bluetooth these to my laptop, I-Pad and Android Galaxy Phone....So I am happy..."
148,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"  Exactly like what you will get from the Apple store! Came in brand new nicely packaged and connected very easily to my phone. I have been using it so much and I'm obsessed with these, 100% recommend!"
149,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Worth it,  Apple is Apple
150,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Great Product!,  My daughter loves them! Great product.
151,"September 29, 2020",1.0,Air Pods not worth the money.,  I wish I would not have purchased these Air Pods.  The battery does not last very long.  I charge the Air Pods and they don't keep a charge.  The longest I have been able to use them is 1 hour.  This is definitely not worth the money.  Don't purchase!!!!!!
152,"September 29, 2020",5.0,My Son works for Apple and these are genuine,  My Son works for Apple as a Genius and he confirmed that these are GENUINE APPLE AIRPODS!!
153,"September 29, 2020",5.0,The item you though you did not need,"  For years I have been using wired ones. I cannot imagine going back to that. I have issues with them while I run, I have to be aware of that. This coronavirus times had helped with this, since I have been wearing a buff covering my ears and avoiding this earphones falling on the street. In home I use them for this annoying virtual work thing."
154,"September 29, 2020",5.0,The best,  Can't go wrong!
155,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Thank you,  All good
156,"September 29, 2020",1.0,Used product,  I received a used product
157,"September 29, 2020",4.0,Great Quality product!,"  This is the 2nd pair I ordered after I purchased a pair for my wife as a gift. We both work from home, and one of the most important issues we had with other headphones was comfort and how the person on the other end of the call could hear. Sound quality, and comfort was great and the charging station? which also holds a charge is an added plus if you want to keep your headphones charged when not near a charging outlet.  Overall a great product."
158,"September 29, 2020",1.0,review,  I have these AirPods for about a month and the sound doesn't work in one ear.
159,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Awesome!!,  Purchased these for work meetings on Macbook and works perfectly with great sound/call quality.
160,"September 29, 2020",5.0,ncie,  nice
161,"September 29, 2020",5.0,Nice sound. Friend was excited!,  Bought them for a friend and she absolutely loves them so much I may have to get myself a pair and I was so against it because they looked weird to me.
162,"September 29, 2020",1.0,Left ear stopped working,  Don’t buy if you like to hear the music
163,"September 29, 2020",5.0,"The sound quality is clear, the sound is very loud and the reception is very strong","  Easy to carry.Available range, from the bedroom to the kitchen no problem earphone workmanship, very beautiful, very practical, the packaging is simply too delicate, earphone color is also beautiful.The sound quality is clear, the sound is very loud, the reception signal is very strong, and it is very comfortable to wear in the ears. The quality of the headphones can be said to be very good. When running, you can run with your mobile phone, wireless is convenient, and you should take this excellent sound quality headset with you whenever you go out"
164,"September 28, 2020",4.0,Fit well on my ears...,  Overall are good just alil slippery
165,"September 28, 2020",2.0,Was damages left ear piece! Not happy,"  Came with one ear piece silent, not working!"
166,"September 28, 2020",5.0,Makes riding my bike a dream,  I love the air pods. My only problem is getting them to connect to my phone.  Overall great
167,"September 28, 2020",5.0,Really Blew me Away!!!!,  You know I have tried all types of wireless head sets. And I do not know why I did not try this product. When I received then and connected them up. I was pleasantly surprise that this what I have been looking for. Great product and great price.
168,"September 28, 2020",5.0,Nice product easy to use,  My son was in a different world when he recieved these as a gift!!Couldnt get them out of his ear lolHe loved them
169,"September 28, 2020",5.0,Good Headphones!,"  Decent headphones, audio quality is fine. Battery life is decent. Big life improvement over corded headphones, but if you're particular about audio quality perhaps spend more on the better version. I use mine for watching streams and listening to music and am happy with them."
170,"September 28, 2020",1.0,Instruction book,"  The product is good but the instructions are printed in light gray on white paper and print so small that I can't read it with my good reading glasses and a magnifying glass.  I would prefer it if they gave me one sheet of paper with an internet address that is legible so I could download it.  Also, the ad on amazon could have the model number because there are several versions of this device.  If I knew it I could download the manual myself. Amazon and Apple dropped the ball big time on this one!"
171,"September 27, 2020",5.0,"No regrets, very good purchase.","  Nice quality, I am happy with the purchase."
172,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Excellent exactly what she wanted!Thanks a bunch
173,"September 27, 2020",1.0,Horrible,  They stop working after a couple weeks
174,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Best battery life,  These are the best headphones ever! My 3rd time buying 🥰!!
175,"September 27, 2020",5.0,great to used at work,"  great to used at work , and very personal sound ,"
176,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Good buy!,  Love them. Great price cheaper to buy off here than Best Buy or anywhere else.
177,"September 27, 2020",1.0,Defectusos,  Los compre como regalo para mi mamá t llegaron defectuosos
178,"September 27, 2020",5.0,So far so good,  So far so good. I got the renewed AirPods from certified by Amazon. I think I actually got 2nd gen AirPods so that’s a nice surprise! They also seem authentic and everything checks out.Will update!
179,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Ok,  Great
180,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Confortable,  Everything is okay and good I love it
181,"September 27, 2020",3.0,Good not great.,  My main issue with these and every pair of apple earbuds and airpods is that the right one always creates problems.  The sound in my right bud doesn’t work when I put them in so it always has to be ‘rebooted’. It’s annoying!  If noise cancellation is important don’t purchase these.
182,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Excelent,"  I really liked the product, it arrived very fast and excellent quality."
183,"September 27, 2020",1.0,Missing item,  I opened the package and the airpod box inside was empty and unsealed.
184,"September 27, 2020",1.0,Inaccurate listing of airpods,"  I ordered these (new) airpods and when They arrived, the box inside of the package was already open. They were not sealed like someone would expect when purchasing something new.  When I synced them to my iPhone they were already registered to someone else! Keep in mind I ordered these new. Not used or refurbished. Also the Siri was incredible sensitive. If I said anything that rhymed with “Siri” it would then activate. Extremely frustrating when working from home. I ended up returning them. Beware of this buyer. These could potentially be fake."
185,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Lo mejor,  Me encanto
186,"September 27, 2020",5.0,These are awesome!,  Sounds great even though they’re not the Pro version. Great for everyday calls or listening!
187,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Get em while you can,  It’s excellent
188,"September 27, 2020",5.0,La calidad de los productos,  Me encantan y no es necesario andar el teléfono en la mano
189,"September 27, 2020",5.0,Original AirPods,"  My AirPods arrived pretty quickly. I was pretty scared after a couple of people on here complained about them being fake. But Amazon is an authorized Apple dealer- that was reassuring... I was happy to see that they were original when they arrived.About the product:  I absolutely love the sound quality, it’s crisp and balanced. The pods are pretty secure in my ears, so I’m not even afraid of them falling out!I’d definitely recommend this product."
190,"September 26, 2020",1.0,Alright but not for me,  Had these for a few days and the right ear piece does seem to be quieter than the left by a hefty margin. The sound is alright sub or compared to the wired but with those they are meant to be better sound quality. The battery life was alright they last 4 hours real day use and charge up quick. Overall didn’t enjoy them but they might be for people who don’t like wires.
191,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Very good,"  The quality of apple's headphones is very good. The sound quality is not as good as expected, but it's acceptable. It's easy to listen to music on the phone"
192,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Happy with purchase!,  Great product so far. Easy set up. No issues. Just what I needed for a good price.
193,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Awesome!,"  Hesitated buying these for a long time and so glad I finally did. Great headphones for listening to music and tuning everything else out. Works well for making calls, the person on the other end never complains that there is a bad connection. Definitely will buy these again!"
194,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Great product!,  Love these for virtual teaching! So helpful!
195,"September 26, 2020",5.0,good product,  personal
196,"September 26, 2020",5.0,good,  i like these but the pros are better
197,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Very useful,  No complaints. Everything works great!
198,"September 26, 2020",5.0,It’s worth every penny,"  I prefer the comfort of this type of earphones. I purchased an offbrand prior to Apple. I returned them because I had trouble in the first two weeks. They wouldn’t pair or wouldn’t charge properly. The Apple sound better, work better, they charge better, and I haven’t had any trouble with them. I wouldn’t waste my money on offbrands"
199,"September 26, 2020",5.0,They are perfect....,"  COVID kept me from leaving the house, meaning stuck at home with everyone home talking over each other and going on with their general daily task. With these basically received over night, totally sound proof I was able to actually listen to something I was looking at on my phone."
200,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Funcional,  Excelente
201,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Very good,  Love these AirPods for my daily walking.
202,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Great,  Use these everyday for my commute back and forth to work and throughout the day to listen to pod casts. Great sound quality
203,"September 26, 2020",5.0,The best,  Just what we been looking for!!
204,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  They work well for work!
205,"September 26, 2020",5.0,long battery,  mines were brand new and came with a charger

207,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Calidad,   Muy bueno
208,"September 26, 2020",4.0,reliable,  Still working after all this time.
209,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Must Have,"  I was skeptical at first, but now I'm a believer. They work great, easy to use, and super convenient. Love them."
210,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Great Thank You!,"  Looks really great, feels really great"
211,"September 26, 2020",5.0,Best purchase,  These maybe the best head phones I’ve ever purchased. The only thing I would say is once you take them out an don’t put them away correctly it is easy to loose
212,"September 26, 2020",5.0,"Small and compact.Excellent product,recommend to anyone interested.",  Everything I expected it to be.
213,"September 25, 2020",5.0,awesome sound and very comfy,  I had some ear buds that sound great but they dont feel comfortable after watching programs or listening to music for more than a hour these sound super awesome and feel extremely comfortable in my ears and i love how when you use apple products it will automatically pause when you take one bud out your ear to go do something
214,"September 25, 2020",5.0,The product you are buying!,  My granddaughters loved them.  Apple is a great brand!
215,"September 25, 2020",2.0,Stopped Working After 1.5 Months,  The right airpod stopped working. I used it for  everyday use.
216,"September 25, 2020",2.0,Not impressed,  People get these for the name. If you want good sound quality is get something else. If you want Apple product for the name get these.
217,"September 25, 2020",3.0,Not suitable for music,  Sounds like crap compared to Sennheiser $30 regular earbuds
218,"September 25, 2020",1.0,Not worth it,"  I purchased these a while back - before the lockdown, and the first few times i used them they both worked fine. after a while the right airpod stopped working.  Again, not worth it."
219,"September 25, 2020",1.0,No funcionan correctamente,"  Después de 4 días de uso no funcionan correctamente, un AirPod se descarga completamente mientras al otro aún le resta 26% de batería, habiéndolos usados a la vez."
220,"September 25, 2020",5.0,It was a gift. Much loved,  I bought it for my grandson and he loves them!
221,"September 25, 2020",1.0,Empty box,  The airpod box was empty except for the charging cord
222,"September 25, 2020",5.0,Great purchase!!!!!,  I love my pods I’m glad I made this purchase !!
223,"September 25, 2020",4.0,Cool headphone great sound quality,"  I bought these for my daughter for her birthday. Sometime they have a connecting issue but it’s easy to resolve.They are great headphones. The sound quality when listening to music is excellent. Some phone calls are muffled, but most are crystal clear. I love That they can detect when they are in your ear and when they are not. When listening to music my daughter prefers them both in her ear she said it’s not as loud with one. These also have a locator on them if you lose them they can give off a siren noise to find them. They do slide out the ear. It’s annoying to me but my daughter doesn’t seem too bothered by it. Overall great headphones. And to answer many questions you can pair your AirPods with other devices. If you tap your air pods it can answer your phone calls and end them. If your listening to music and you tap them twice they can switch to the next song"
224,"September 25, 2020",5.0,GREAT PRODUCT,  NEPHEW LOVES THEM!
225,"September 25, 2020",5.0,Great in quality & sound quality,  So good! I recommend
226,"September 25, 2020",2.0,Stopped Syncing,"  This product was great, but after about 5 months they stopped syncing to my phone. I ran every diagnostic test and tried everything the internet and Apple told me to try. Still nothing.It's obnoxious that products like these are beholden to the one month return window. That's okay for something like a shirt or mop. But tech should have a much longer window.Just another reason I stopped buying from Amazon."
227,"September 25, 2020",5.0,Nice and fashionable pair,  My teenage daughter loves it.
228,"September 25, 2020",1.0,👎👎👎👎👎👎,"  Sent a defected item , was disappointed ."
229,"September 25, 2020",4.0,Waterproof?!,  I accidentally left my AirPods (in the case) in my workout pants and washed them. They still work! My only complaint is that they don’t fit my ears quite right and they start to slip out if I get too sweaty. Otherwise they’re amazing.
230,"September 25, 2020",5.0,They work really good .,  I really like them. I’m happy I brought them .
231,"September 24, 2020",3.0,product need to improve,  after using for 8 months .My friends won't hear my voice when i talked to them.
232,"September 24, 2020",4.0,. They just don’t make any more sounds except for the connection sound.,"  I mean honestly, I expected them to be exactly like the ones that came with all the previous generations of iPod and Apple iPhone only with no wires… I feel like there’s a slight variation in how powerful they are meaning less powerful than the ones with the wires but more importantly yeah mine just kind of stopped working. Have them for less than two weeks they make you like the noise when they connect to the iPhone and when they disconnect, This tells me that it’s not like a mechanical problem on the EarPods them selves like getting wet or some thing they just don’t work frankly it’s really really irritating."
233,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Authentic,  Just like the AirPods I bought from the Apple store.
234,"September 24, 2020",3.0,"Good sound, battery life unequal between the two AirPods.",  Sound quality is fine just like normal apple earbuds it could be louder. These have no noise cancellation just like regular apple earbuds. The battery life would get 5 stars if it lived up to the specification but for for some reason one of my airpods loses battery life faster. When the battery begins to drop under 30% one of them always drops about 10% lower than the other even though I’m using both of them at the same time. I don’t know if this is normal of if I received a defective unit. I bought apple care for these but all the apple stores are currently closed. I don’t think that is normal and I’d expect more from a $130+ product.
235,"September 24, 2020",3.0,quality,"  overall, it is great, but sometime it have a bit malfunction"
236,"September 24, 2020",5.0,sounds is great,  First pair I ever had love them
237,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Nothing,  It's perfect
238,"September 24, 2020",1.0,These things are NOT compatible with Windows 10 or Android devices!!!,  These things are NOT compatible with Windows 10 or Android devices!!! I am sure that it is by design. Apple has always been an elitist outfit and considers us non-apple users inferior.
239,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Life changing!,  THE BEST!!!!! CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT THEM!
240,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Hahe,  Muy bueno
241,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Love them,  I have had my Apple AirPods for a couple of months now definitely recommend
242,"September 24, 2020",5.0,5/5,  These probably are the best AirPods I’ve bought that haven’t broken
243,"September 24, 2020",4.0,Good but doesn’t stay in my ear good,  Bought these to use when walking. The sound is great. My only objection is that I don’t feel like they stay in well. I’m constantly adjusting them in my ear and have had them fall out a few times.
244,"September 24, 2020",5.0,High quality product,  High quality product.  Good sound.
245,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Can't Be Beat,"  I've had many, many, many headphones. Nothing beats the AirPods. The noise cancellation is superb as well as the sound and responsiveness to removing an ear bud/pausing/etc."
246,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Works great if you get a good pair,  The first pair I ordered did not work the left side wouldn’t hold a charge and it was the first day I got them. The second pair works wonderfully!! Thank you for the replacement. I guess with these buds only some work and others don’t idk lol
247,"September 24, 2020",5.0,I am so satisfied with this product,  Packing was very Secure the sound is so quality this my 1at Apple everything I am so satisfied with this product
248,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Make sure you get the correct harness so you will not lose one,  They are great products the sBattery lifeis just horrible
249,"September 24, 2020",3.0,Earbuds are too large,  Unfortunately the earbuds are too large for my ears. Someone just told me the noise cancelling ones are smaller but I already threw out the box sonI guess Inam stuck with them.
250,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
251,"September 24, 2020",5.0,I use them everyday,"  I have an iPhone and wanted a good pair of wireless headphones but without Apple's price. After trying about 6 different brands and returning them or just wasting money on them I decided to bite the bullet and just get the Air Pods, now I wish I did it sooner. They sound great, I like that I can just say Hey Siri to change the volume, and they are so useful. I use them daily when working by either listening to music when working on a project or talking to customers, I also use them when mowing the lawn or just running to the store. These do not noise canceling but they isolate the background noise well but not to the point where you cant hear around you. I am surprised on how long the battery actually lasts for such a small package, also the storage case/charger is great because if I am running low on power I just plug them in for 15 min or so and have enough power to take several more calls.I would recommend these to others and I am even going to buy a pair for my fiance to replace her off the wall wireless earbuds."
252,"September 24, 2020",1.0,Used. Arrived in an opened package,  Package was not wrapped in plastic. Look like it was opened and the new AirPods replaced with used ones.
253,"September 24, 2020",5.0,great product,  great product
254,"September 24, 2020",1.0,Waste of money,"   Just got these last week. It just stop connecting to my iPhone, nothing I do seems to be working. I’ve tried resetting it but it won’t even let me do that. The white light just stays on"
255,"September 24, 2020",5.0,"Use everyday, great sound, seamless integration. Good job Apple!","  Amazing! Worth the money. I was on the fence of getting the new AirPod Pros or the AirPod 2nd Generation. I’m glad I went with the 2nd Gen AirPods. They are extremely comfortable. Sometime I forget they’re in (no bull...). It connects so seamlessly to my iPhone and feels like it belongs. I tried the Jabras... uncomfortable and no touchless “Hey Siri”. This even reads messages to you or can annouce who’s calling by tweaking some of your General Settings. I use them everyday. Start my morning with Youtube and Apple News updates, make calls, listen to music while working. They seem expensive but it’s worth the money. I also like that they don’t cancel out all of the noise and also work independently (I usually only have one in). However, when I really want full sound for music, I put both in and can barely hear the wind and road noise, on the highway, with the windows down. Good job Apple!"

259,"September 24, 2020",5.0,Airpods saved my marriage!,"  In the age of Coronavirus, we're all working from home. Everyone wants to watch TV while the other is working, or we all have Zoom meetings at the same time. Thanks to Airpods, we can be isolated from each other like we used to be back in the days when we would go to our separate offices for work."
260,"September 24, 2020",4.0,Great product reasonable price,"  Great product, was a gift for my daughter.  didn't need more costly version these have been great."

266,"September 23, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Love them
267,"September 23, 2020",1.0,Half a product is no product at all🙃,  For the side that did work it sounded amazing but the other side didn’t work no matter what I did. So it’s basically useless. Thanks🖕🏾
268,"September 23, 2020",5.0,I GIVE ALL 5 Stars ⭐️‼️,   First off let’s just say ITS THE REAL DEAL and no I’m not a fake review nor payed to say this ish. Like this is real and it work AMAZING the music is super loud and have the base and sounds like the singers singing right in my ear it’s amazing. And also sounds clear when I am otp with ppl and they said they can also hear me very clearly. However I was skeptical at first cause ppl said they got theirs dirty or not in the box. But mines came clean and perfect I LOVE THEM!
269,"September 23, 2020",5.0,recharge a lot,  case dies fast but other than that i love them
270,"September 23, 2020",5.0,Apple must have,  Love them very sleek but battery could last longer
271,"September 23, 2020",1.0,No good,  Quit working after 3 months
272,"September 23, 2020",4.0,They're Reliable,"  Obviously a good product, does the job. Not the best if you're wanting noise cancelling, but they still work very well."
273,"September 23, 2020",5.0,Very fast delivery,  I got it really fast! I love the sound quality and very easy to set up.
274,"September 23, 2020",2.0,This pair was defective and I could not return after 30 days.,  Air pods sound quality stopped working after 2 months. The description said they were supposed to work for two years. The first pair I purchased for my daughter prior to this purchase works fine.
275,"September 23, 2020",1.0,Don't work well,"  I've only had these for one day and they cut out all the time. Not reliable at all, I'm returning them."
276,"September 23, 2020",1.0,Not worth it.,"  For about the first 6 months, the AirPods work great, no problems, no nothing. But after about 6 months of use, the sound on the AirPods start to get really quiet to the point that full blast sounds like it’s only at 45-50% (and yes I do clean my AirPods). For the amount of money I paid for these, I’m strongly disappointed that I couldn’t go a full year without having problems."
277,"September 23, 2020",5.0,Good Quality,  Easy to pair to multiple devicesclear although very loud
278,"September 23, 2020",5.0,Love them. Recommend this product.,"  Secure, comfortable fit for my small ears.Great battery life so far."

282,"September 23, 2020",1.0,REFUND THE INSURANCE CHARGE ON THESE APPLE IPODS,  I also need to return the $19.00 Charge for insurance on these
283,"September 23, 2020",5.0,"If I Lose These, I Will Immediately Buy Another Pair","  I was really skeptical of airpods for a long time. They felt like an unnecessary expense and I didn't think they could possibly life up to the hype. Then they went on sale over Labor Day weekend. I bought a pair.I absolutely LOVE these and if I lose them, I will immediately replace them. Best investment in a long time."
284,"September 23, 2020",1.0,Broken within 6 months,  I’ve had my AirPods since March of this year. For the last month the left side will not hold a charge no matter what I try. I’m really upset about this
285,"September 23, 2020",5.0,Very satisfied,  I love them!
286,"September 23, 2020",5.0,THE PRICE,  SOUND QUALITY BATTERY LIFE
287,"September 23, 2020",1.0,Two times ordering this and both were defective,  I ordered and reordered this item. Both times it was defective in terms of the battery not charging and the one earpiece not working despite reset.  I was warned that buying Apple products from amazon might be an issue and now I can see why.
288,"September 22, 2020",1.0,Do not buy,  Ordered pods. Lasted a couple weeks and one failed. Got replacement and lasted a couple weeks and failed again.
289,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Love them!!,"  Everything is perfect, no complaints. I have small ears so the noise cancellation doesn’t really work for me :("
290,"September 22, 2020",2.0,Should be less than what i paid for,"  the right airpod barely works, but charging case is very nice, and the left airpod is ok"
291,"September 22, 2020",1.0,Can't get extended warranty,  Purchased these airpods on 9/20/2020 but the actual purchase on them were 9/2019 which voids applecare warranty and the 1 year standard warranty.
292,"September 22, 2020",4.0,Works great,  Love my AirPods.
293,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Bought as a gift for a 12-year-old he’s quite happy with them,"  This was a gift for my grand son, he’s perfectly happy with them."
294,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Great,  Awesome
295,"September 22, 2020",1.0,No Good,"  I was so happy when I purchase them a friend of mine, said something about AirPods so I decided to get them.. all was well until 2 months later... they stopped working so I called Amazon great customer service but they didn’t do anything for me and plus I got the pros for my father and they were stolen.. I couldn’t make a police report bcuz or my wife’s death I’m so hurt I just lost $450 in AirPods for nothing..After spending more then $7000 that month I’m done with Amazon.. no thank you"
296,"September 22, 2020",5.0,No issues,  I’ve had the air pods for 6 months now and still no issues
297,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Granddaughter loves them!,  Bought for my granddaughter and she loves them!
298,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Well worth the price,"  I’ve had a few sets of the cheap knock-offs, and there is REALLY no comparison. These have great quality sound, work flawlessly in phone calls, and pair seamlessly with my iPhone and my iPad!  Well worth the extra $."
299,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Loved the quality of the sound super loud
300,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Actually not fake and they are real,  After reading the reviews people made it seem like they are not real thats just not true dont worry this is from apple and these are actual airpods.
301,"September 22, 2020",2.0,Don’t stay in ears,  Don’t stay in your ears and are not comfortable. Don’t waste your money
302,"September 22, 2020",1.0,Empty container nice job Amazon,  Opened my Amazon box then saw the AirPods box had no plastic around it open the box and it’s empty highly disappointed I work 10hr shifts and comes home to this just had to take my lunch break to go buy in store
303,"September 22, 2020",5.0,Los mejores,"  Son livianos y muy cómodos, su batería y su carga duran mucho. El audio es excelente!"
304,"September 22, 2020",1.0,No llego los audífonos en el paquete,  No llego estos audífonos en el pedido
305,"September 22, 2020",1.0,Microphones Stopped Working,"  After a year of working well, the microphones just stopped working. None of Apples support recommendations helped. I have not discovered a way to get support from Amazon."
306,"September 21, 2020",5.0,GOOD PRICE AND AUTHENTIC,  Priced great And theyre authentic from apple
307,"September 21, 2020",1.0,It is impossible to fathom that Apple can't figure out bluetooth for Windows PC,"  Airpods from Apple work seamlessly, perfectly fine with an Iphone. However, they keep disconnecting, at times even during the calls on Zoom or Teams. Even connecting it to Bluetooth is so troublesome that I have to restart the system to get it to work. I am not the only person who has faced this issue; I have checked with four friends of mine, who also have faced the same problem.Either Windows or Apple is deliberately screwing up the system to not allow this thing to work seamlessly with Windows. Overall, it is impossible to fathom that Apple can't figure out bluetooth for Windows PC.There is no doubt that it took decades for other firms, and yet they couldn't figure out the shape of the ears and design a comfortable handsfree for human ear. The airpod design even from the wired stage, is the first and even now as well, the only one which fits comfortably in the human ear without causing a feling of pluggedness.It is a pity that I had to return this product."
308,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Just because its apple doesnt mean its always the best,"  Overall the airpods are ok, but they're very expensive when you could easily spend the money elsewhere and get somewhat similar quality bluetooth headphones. Not always does the battery life display on your phone or device sometimes i have to open and close the case a few times for the phone and or ipad to be able to see my device. It doesnt always connect either, thats another thing I dont like about these things. Also they can fall out easily from your ears and thats really ridiculous when you're already paying a premium price for the things. I have a pair of Bluetooth tenergy headphones that are water proof and bluetooth and do not fall out of my ears whatsoever because they have these black arms that wrap around the backs of your ears. They only costed me like $30 bucks and here im spending much more and they dont even stay in my ears at all."
309,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Comfortable and long battery life,  Love these!!! They retain battery life and last for days while teleworking and constantly being on video chat. I went through 3 other pairs of knock off brands and they dont compare. They're so comfortable and span long range of sound away from laptop.
310,"September 21, 2020",4.0,airpods  worked great.,"  these airpods were amazing. although a few weeks after i got them, the sound quality was awful. but it then got better. i’m not sure if it was just that i got them wet, but they are back in perfect workin order now. fully recommend this seller for this product."
311,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Very reliable,  This product is perfect because it prevents the hassle of wires. 10/10 recommended
312,"September 21, 2020",5.0,amazing,  absolutely love
313,"September 21, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy!,  Received a scratched up case and the AirPods lose connection constantly and break up a lot. Do not buy. These are not up to working conditions.
314,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Best,  Simply the best
315,"September 21, 2020",1.0,Fake,  Terrible. Very static. These are fake
316,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Best of Bests,  Best voice quality and it is easy to control.
317,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  I love these!!
318,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Love it as described,  Love it as described
319,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Air pods,  Nothing
320,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Charge fast have long time battery,  Very nice they fit
321,"September 21, 2020",1.0,Crap,  I bought 2 sets and both stopped working within 4 months. I was told I was unable to return them.
322,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Great,  Gym
323,"September 21, 2020",2.0,It’s ok,  The item is ok but it’s not that good. Don’t waste your money. Your ears start to hurt for awhile after having them in for a certain amount of times.
324,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Worth it !,  I use it mostly with my phone
325,"September 21, 2020",5.0,I love my AirPods!,  10000/10
326,"September 21, 2020",5.0,They stay charged for a while.,  Very good sound quality.
327,"September 21, 2020",5.0,love them,  Was iffy from the reviews but I’ve had mines for maybe over 2 weeks and no problems will update if any problems
328,"September 21, 2020",1.0,Only one headphone works!,  Only one headphone work. I am so sad
329,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Best price on amazon,"  New in original packaging, sound great. Thanks"
330,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Awesome purchase,  Came fully charged
331,"September 21, 2020",5.0,LOVE my airpods.,  Best thing that ever.
332,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Better than iPods2,  Bought both but love it much better than air iPods2.
333,"September 21, 2020",3.0,Would like some changes.,  It is not very snug in your year.  Comes off easily. Wish had something over the year to be secure.  Would like volume control on the unit.
334,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Replacement,  My one ear bud stopped taking a charge. How can I exchange these
335,"September 21, 2020",5.0,"No complaints , work well",  These AirPods work great. I would recommend
336,"September 21, 2020",5.0,Worth buying,"  The earphones are beautiful and the colors are lovely. Take very comfortable, go out to run, also won't drop, earphone sound insulation effect is very good, when running with music can't be too loud, otherwise can't hear the car sound. When you run in the gym, you can be a little louder, and the world is all about you, very awesome. The sound quality is so good that it's worth the price. It's fully charged, you can enjoy it, and the battery is good. The Bluetooth signal is stable and it's easy to answer the phone. It's much better than what I bought before"
337,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Love them.,  Good over all. The wired earbuds usually hurt my small ear canals but these some how fit better and are more comfortable.
338,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Nice to have,  Works like it should
339,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Get what you asked for
340,"September 20, 2020",1.0,I was sent used AirPods,"  The arrived without cellophane and opened. The charging wire was tangled and they were clearly used. When we turned them on, there was a name attached to them already (jung’s AirPods). The charging case is flimsy and feels fake. I am returning these and I am very, very disappointed. They were intended to be a gift for my daughter."
341,"September 20, 2020",5.0,The Joy of Air Pods!,"  I use this product several times a week when I go out walking.  Am enjoying it immensely ,  I walk a lot further with music that I love keeping me entertained."
342,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Yes,  great
343,"September 20, 2020",1.0,Not good,  The right ear pod isn’t working well
344,"September 20, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money,  Had these for less than 2 months and they are already don’t work.
345,"September 20, 2020",5.0,These are in fact gen 2 airpods in a gen 1 case,"  First off These are gen 2 airpods in a gen 1 case so it comes with the added Siri functionality and such, just not the wireless charging of course. They sound pretty crisp for the most part, and they embrace bass instead of being allergic to it like some cheaper wireless earbuds. They charge really really fast too, 15 minutes of charging for 3 hours of playtime! The experience is seamless, everything works as it should consistently. Not many earbuds topping these besides the pros of course. Good buy"
346,"September 20, 2020",2.0,Stop working,  just last night ..only had these  6 months??
347,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Work very well,  The airpod works very well. I just bought one for my friend and she loves it.
348,"September 20, 2020",4.0,Overall good earbuds,  Decent earbuds wish battery was better but overall i enjoy using them.
349,"September 20, 2020",1.0,DOA,"  Wasn’t able to use them, kept disconnecting from the device.."
350,"September 20, 2020",1.0,Not real airpods,  These are not real air pops they are knock offs. I didnt notice until I got myself a pair from Mac.  They are built ok and do work. But not worth $130.00.
351,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Good investment,  I love them and it’s so much better than wired headphones
352,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Highly recommended,"  Product arrived new and worked as intended. I was a little hesitant based on reviews about purchasing non authentic air pods through sellers “other than Apple” but after a little research and another buyer’s recommendation on how to determine authenticity of products and sellers, I went ahead and made the purchase. Completely satisfied with the price, quality, authenticity, and ease of purchase.  Everything worked as intended, no issues, and i feel good that if I did have problems, Amazon/Apple would do what was necessary to guarantee my satisfaction with the purchase."
353,"September 20, 2020",5.0,Great sound,  Love them
354,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Great,  Like brand new
355,"September 19, 2020",5.0,BUY ITTTTT,  they are the real deal. work perfectly. no problems at all.
356,"September 19, 2020",4.0,Very light and easy to use!,  The most feature about these AirPods is they are super easy to carry with and I feel comfortable doing workout while listening to my music through those AirPods. Although my main complaint is about the battery life of those AirPods which does not take longer than 4 hours constantly talking using them!
357,"September 19, 2020",2.0,i hate it here.,"  my airpods randomly cut out at times , the sound is so low in my ears even when it’s all the up on my phone . people can hear my music from my airpods."
358,"September 19, 2020",2.0,Connectivity,"  They have good quality but they lose connection far too often. I’m a very active person and these headphones can’t keep up. When I go on runs or workout in general, the headphones will stop playing music, which requires me to pull out my phone to play it. The right bud also frequently loses connection causing my music to stop. Not worth it."
359,"September 19, 2020",5.0,They are good,  It took me long to get airpods because I didn't have money and because i heard different opinions o f people some saying they were good other that they were bad. I finally bought them because I had extra money and i like them a lot. The battery seems to last long because i barely run out of battery. They sound great too.
360,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Great Airpods,"  Simply love these airpods, swiftly switches between apple devices."
361,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Definitely recommend!,"  Awesome investment! They don’t fall out of my ears, which I was afraid of. They have great features that allow you to assign functions to each ear bud for touch-sensitivity (to control volume, skip the track, or repeat the track). They pair automatically to your iPhone and connect to MacBook Pro and iPad Pro to use as microphones and/or headphones! Great sound quality and charge super quickly!!"
362,"September 19, 2020",1.0,These are used!!!,  These are used AirPods. I received a box that looked like it had been in the garbage and the AirPods themselves were dirty. I was not expecting used AirPods and I even checked the description to make sure I didn’t miss anything. No where did it say they were going to be used or refurbished. So I contacted support. I asked why the item was used and it didn’t say it was on the description and the rep really made it seem like they did not want to answer my question and just asked me if I could return the item. I asked if they were authentic Apple AirPods and if they would be new and she said yes so I agreed to get a replacement. The replacement was also a used or refurbished pair. Oh and the original pair I received wouldn’t even pair to my iPhone. I’ve returned both sets and am still waiting for a refund weeks after I returned them.
363,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Worth it if you’re debating whether to buy or not,"  So far they’ve been great. Even forgot them in my jeans, and they went through the washer and dryer and still work!"
364,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  real nice worth the money
365,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Airpod2,"  Great products , can be made more durable"
366,"September 19, 2020",5.0,dose the job I got them for,  only down side is they are trying to pair with every iphone in the house  even after being paired with my phone
367,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,"  These are Gen 2 AirPods work great, amazing sound quality ability to get AppleCare if you choose to."

369,"September 19, 2020",5.0,Works great not just for phones but computers also!,  My daughter loves them she even uses them and uses them for everyday use and on her computer for virtual school
370,"September 19, 2020",5.0,They are bad but,  The best of the best
371,"September 18, 2020",5.0,This product fits the seller's description.,  This product fits the seller's description.
372,"September 18, 2020",2.0,Bluetooth and battery don’t last long,"  Disappointed more in the product was delivered. Open box item. The AirPods looked new, so I tried them and the sound is ok. Bluetooth connection in calls is not the best, but is decent. Siri helps a lot with hands free phone calls and text. Awesome feature. Not much difference from first gen though. Will return for replacement as I may have gotten a defective item with the on off Bluetooth call connections. Battery life isn’t the greatest but you get a good 3-4 hours when new. Charging case battery 1 Star. 2 charges and done, not cool. Again I may have gotten a defective item, I’ll try again after I get a brand new set!!!"
373,"September 18, 2020",5.0,Item as expected and shipped on time !,  Apple products you can never go wrong. Item as described and great shipping during the high season of the holidays.
374,"September 18, 2020",5.0,"Good workmanship, great texture","  The sound quality is very good, clear, ethereal, listening to music is excellent, better than the ordinary wired headphones, the children especially like.It's very comfortable to wear and doesn't feel uncomfortable to wear for a long time.Charger is a collection box, is an integral, connect the mobile phone, play the operation is very simple, easy to use.And still have certain waterproof function, suit to wear when moving."
375,"September 18, 2020",4.0,These things are awesome !!!,"  I bought another, cheaper brand and after spending more time trying to get them to pair with my iphone 7+ than I did listening to anything, I returned them and ordered these. These were trying to pair with the phone almost before I took them out of the box !  So far I've only used the left pod. I use them in my shop and need to hear other things periodically, but have had no problems at all to this point. If I had one thing negative to say, it wouild be the battery life, but I'm sure not sorry I ordered them !"
376,"September 18, 2020",5.0,Very good product,  Very nice product I love them fit very well have not broke
377,"September 18, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy from Amazon,  Product worked great for one month and of course the 30 day return policy was up they passed the buck onto APPLE and of course they were a lot more helpful than Amazon!! Buyers beware!!
378,"September 18, 2020",5.0,AMAZING‼️,"  Believe it or not I looked at every review and just decided to risk it, These are literally air pods from apple they are real. I had put the air pods in my Gen 2 case and it worked perfectly . So happy with them 👍🏼"
379,"September 18, 2020",1.0,Only one side works,"  bought it in June and now only one earpod works. No sound from left one and I have tried all: reset, clean repeat."

I saved money and I’m so happy about it. Also, super fast shipping. AirPods? Totally worth it😍 there isn’t a day that I don’t use them."
386,"September 18, 2020",5.0,These are the best,  I love the sound quality and the way they fit into my ears.  The charging case stays charged for a long period of time.

395,"September 17, 2020",1.0,"THEY ONLY WORK FOR 1 MONTH, THEN YOU CAN’T HEAR ANYMORE😡","  I’ve purchased this product twice from Amazon and was about to order a third time as a gift until I realized they start to lose sound quality extremely early. They work fine when they first arrive for about a month. After that, they get extremely low and watching movies and videos or listening to music becomes less enjoyable because I’m struggling to hear. I’m very dissatisfied because they are $140 a pair and I’ve already gone through 2 pair in less than 4 months. I will not be ordering again."
396,"September 17, 2020",5.0,It’s very nice and originalI like it,  It’s very nice and original
397,"September 17, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Very satisfied with my purchase... bought them for my daughter and she loves them! Great price and shipped fast.
398,"September 17, 2020",2.0,Case stopped charging after 1 month,  Only had these AirPods for a month and the case stopped charging. Waste of money.
399,"September 17, 2020",5.0,good item,  Granddaughter loves them as a birthday gift
400,"September 17, 2020",5.0,quality of the item,  they're great
401,"September 17, 2020",4.0,Great sound but uncomfortable till ears get adjusted,  The sounds is great and battery life is pretty good. They hurt my ears for a while in the beginning. Even left little sore in each ear. I guess my ears have adjusted and all is fine now. Noise cancellation isn’t the best on this model.
402,"September 17, 2020",5.0,A Teen’s choice,  My grandson is enjoying the pods!
403,"September 17, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  The  sound quality awsome
404,"September 17, 2020",5.0,They do what they’re supposed to,  I like how easy they work with my stuff. Didn’t want to shell out more dough for the pros.
405,"September 17, 2020",5.0,Made life easier,"  With working more from home, these ipods have made my life easier with being on video conferences and more phone calls too."
406,"September 17, 2020",5.0,Worth the cost-benefit,"  This model suits its purpose. You get a good quality sound, without being a professional product"
407,"September 17, 2020",5.0,👍🏽,  👍🏽
408,"September 17, 2020",3.0,Earbuds won’t stay in ears during workouts.,"  When it comes to sound and appearance, the Apple AirPods are excellent earbuds. However, during workouts, I experienced having issues keeping them in my ears properly. Very frustrating having to readjust them every 15-30 seconds while I’m out for a jog. If you’re needing earbuds for a casual walk or long trips, these are the perfect investment. If you’re needing a pair for workouts and runs, I would purchase a different pair."
409,"September 17, 2020",5.0,Mom likes em,  Gave them to my mom for her birthday she loves em for music and podcasts
410,"September 16, 2020",5.0,good,  good
411,"September 16, 2020",5.0,Solid,  I have these and the pros.. I use these most often because the pros seal my ear and cause wax build up.. these are more comfortable for over long periods of time and allow  your ears to breath
412,"September 16, 2020",1.0,Returned Item,  Did not charge or pair. I returned them.
413,"September 16, 2020",5.0,The best ever,  These are the best I always wanted them thank you sooo much and they charge fast
414,"September 16, 2020",5.0,Cheaper than the apple store!,  These AirPods are perfect. Not having wires is great. Charge last a very long time. Just to let everyone know you can get these on amazon cheaper than the actual apple store.
415,"September 16, 2020",5.0,Great :),"  Not gonna lie, when I first ordered them I was a bit worried they were gonna be fake. BUT they aren’t and they are really nice, totally recommend and you save $."
416,"September 16, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Very useful all the time
417,"September 16, 2020",1.0,Buy Skull Candy Sesh XT Evo’s!!!,"  Overpriced! Buy Skull Candy Sesh XT Evo’s! Better quality for less than half the price! The old Sesh’s sucked, but the XTs last for 5hrs and the case lasts for like 24hrs. I had a flight to Vegas with a layover, I didn’t charge them once and I listened to music the entire time. They also have great bass and volume and work really well for phone calls. I’ve used people’s AirPods and I was not impressed with the low quality of them for how ridiculously expensive they are. Then I found the Sesh XT Evo’s and I don’t think I’ll ever buy anything from overpriced Apple! The only reason I have an iPhone is because my sister gave me this phone for free when she switched carriers."
418,"September 16, 2020",5.0,Work great!,  Work wonderfully! Great to not having any cords hanging down...
419,"September 16, 2020",1.0,not worth the monet,  stopped working after 2.5 months :(
420,"September 16, 2020",4.0,Trustworthy,  My kids took my previous pair so I needed to replace them. I don't use them often for music but mainly for phone calls and they are great for that. They are comfortable as I often forget I have them in my ears.

429,"September 16, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money,  After a few months of use the volume won’t turn up. When I am at the gym I hear the gym speakers over the music I am playing.

I move around a lot and, normal activities like cleaning the house- I am all over the place. These are great and very freeing after being used to wires so much! Great product and Apple has a service where if you don’t like the product you have a few days to return it, luckily I didn’t need to do that with mine! Great sound, great design! Good gift as well!"

437,"September 15, 2020",3.0,Works Best With Apple Products,  These are great earbuds... if you only use them with apple devices!! Ive Tried using these with my Windows computer for watching videos/ movies and the bluetooth keeps dropping out cutting off my audio entirley until i disconnect and reconnect. And i know its this cause ive used them with my iPhone for hours and they work just fine. So if youre going to use these on things that arent made by apple GO LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE DONT WASTE YOURE MONEY

443,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Perfect Earbuds!,  These are the perfect ear bud!  Can wear while mowing and noise cancels out so you can enjoy your music even with loud equipment such as a lawn mower. They are comfortable and come in a nice case. Easy to charge and charge lasts a long time.

451,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Would Recommed,  Fast Delivery. Very safely packaged.
452,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Shouldn’t have waited so long to buy them.,  Great way to listen to conference calls and walk around without the phone.
453,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Apple air pods,  They’re the real deal!
454,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Super,"  Works great, my daughter loves them"
455,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Love these! 4th pair & glad I checked Amazon price,"  I’m kinda embarrassed to admit how many sets of these I’ve bought in the past 2-3 years since version 1 bc teenagers have lost. But I keep buying because there is no product out there that is close to the superiority of Apple. I bought these on Amazon for myself bc they were less expensive than Target and I like the way they fit in my ear vs. the newer round pro’s. I’m happy to report that I use for work & personal calls all day & love! My only tiny complaint is that I wish they held charge for longer than 2-3 hours at a time, but I figure the next version will 😊"
456,"September 15, 2020",3.0,Good,  Works well but quality goes down overtime
457,"September 15, 2020",4.0,The sound quality is good,"  The sound quality is very good, which is one of the reasons I bought it."
458,"September 15, 2020",5.0,Great earphoeba,  These earphones are amazing. They slip into the ear wonderfully and are comfortable. Much better than the wired that would hurt the ears after wearing them for a while. They are great because you can have them on and you can hear people speak. They are not great for noise cancellation.
459,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Really good,  Love
460,"September 14, 2020",5.0,"These are real Apple AirPods, worth the money!!!","  If you’re an Apple fan, you need these in your life! They’re an authentic Apple product & totally worth the price for the quality you receive. I especially love the fact that they automatically turn on when you put them in your ears!"
461,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Nice sound,"  I really like them! Sadly they fall off when I try to lay on my side :( and they die after an hour or so.. but only randomly. Some days they’ll last 2-3 hrs, others only 1 so idk :( but theyre still good. They fully charge in like 10 min"
462,"September 14, 2020",1.0,Could not answer or hang up calls,"  The first pair I got I could not answer or hang up calls with one tap or 2 taps.  I reset them a couple of times, watched you tube videos to be sure I did this right - to no avail.  I would have to run around looking for my phone to answer it while wearing the air pods.  Siri worked fine sending and receiving messages however, music and listening to podcasts was ok also.  So I sent the first pair back to Amazon and got another set.  Same problem again!  Very frustrating. I sent those back and Amazon refunded my purchase price.  Can't figure it out but not good for me."
463,"September 14, 2020",5.0,These a great!,  Quality is great.
464,"September 14, 2020",1.0,garbage,"  first hour they worked fine, but after that they keep disconnecting every 10 seconds. Next time ill just spend my 150$ at Walmart now."
465,"September 14, 2020",2.0,No good.,"  Worst Apple product I have every owned. It works when it connects properly - 50:50 chance most days. I messed for days with it,Looking ip troubleshoots and getting frustrated when one of the buds would disconnect simply because of static or a tiny earring clicking against it. Worst money I’ve ever spent. Should have sent it back when the return window was still open. Now I’ll just use it on day when I have patience to get it to work. Will never purchase a new pair of these and would not recommend. I literally am typing this, while I have my old cord headphones attached to the phone, at least they work foolproof. Save your money, do not get these"
466,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Greats,  It's worth the money
467,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Love it,"  Of course, my son loves these!!!"
468,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Good product.,  Great sound. Good for running. Works as expected.
469,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Charging Case AirPods,  I have the pros but I bought the 1st gens for my sister and I think they fit nicer and feel more comfortable. But the two feature is not the greatest.
470,"September 14, 2020",2.0,Not super loud,  I don't feel that these headphones are super loud nor are they sound canceling. I also have issues with connecting them via bluetooth to my computer
471,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Love apple,  Going to by a set for myself after buying set for my wife
472,"September 14, 2020",3.0,Great when they stay connected,"  Really like them when they work, only had them two months but the three times now the left one did not connect, have had to plug them in to charge and that seems to reset it, one time both went off even though they said connected so I choose “forget this device” then connected again. That’s a lot to go wrong in two months, especially because they haven’t been used every day or even for more than 8 hrs at any given day. Disappointing but I guess I only paid $135 so not premium price. Didn’t want the newest ones as that style doesn’t fit my ears comfortably."
473,"September 14, 2020",3.0,"Feels Cheap, possibly a dupe?","  The materials do not feel like genuine Apple headphones, quality is not great for sound or microphone. I'm pretty sure this is counterfeit. Does not compare to my other set of airpods of the same type that I purchased in a store."
474,"September 14, 2020",4.0,"Convenient for phone calls, not prolonged use.. Battery depleted in about 2 hrs.","  Very convenient and comfortable to wear. Great sound, but not for airplane use. Too much background noise. Use a headset instead. But for every day use, you can’t beat these little gems. Also, because battery life is at most 2 hrs with constant use, these buds are best for just phone calls. I listen to audio books and have switched to a headset because the batteries don’t last very long with prolonged use."
475,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Cordless is great,  Excellent
476,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Love them

482,"September 14, 2020",5.0,Can’t go wrong,  They work great. They stay charged for a long time.

485,"September 14, 2020",1.0,Can't believe these are an Apple product....,"  The longer I have them (and I haven't had them long, too long to return) the worse they get!!!! I can make about 10 calls and then they sound horrible....they sound like there is such a bad connection and garbled....very disappointed in these and wish I had returned them when I had the chance.  Sometimes we get a lemon"

494,"September 14, 2020",1.0,It's too bad,  It's too bad
495,"September 13, 2020",1.0,Left airpod not working out of the box,"  I've been wanting to get wireless earphones for quite some time. Finally ordered these and once I put them in my ears, the right one made the 'on' sound and the left one never did. Both had more than 90% battery life. I played music and the right worked with good sound quality. I tried looking up ways to troubleshoot but sadly nothing worked. I saw a lot of complaints saying one pod stopped working. There is no way I'm paying a high amount for it to be dead like this. Returned it the same day."
496,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Ben,  Ecelnte
497,"September 13, 2020",1.0,SCREW. APPLE.,"  Always having to fight these stupid things to connect to my phone, it's literally the worst. It'll be fine one minute, then next I spend 30 minutes trying to get it to work, even though it has battery life"
498,"September 13, 2020",1.0,Possibly fake AirPods,"  I purchased this product before looking at the reviews, a then noticed how many people had issues with theirs. I had no problems with my pair however, I was skeptical so I went to target and bought Apple AirPods. I instantly could tell a difference. I’m not saying they were fakes but the case opened a lot smoother with the target AirPods and had a button on it. I returned the amazon pair. Not going to risk it, pay the extra and purchase from a reputable store."
499,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Good purchase,  Great sound. Arrived quickly.
500,"September 13, 2020",5.0,perfect !!,  got these off amazon warehouse and they look and work like new !! description said there were cosmetic imperfections but i literally don’t see them
501,"September 13, 2020",5.0,excelent,  love it!! i bought a case for it everything works just fine
502,"September 13, 2020",2.0,Waste of money!,  Used while working for hands free purposes. Product did not cancel noise and bad  sound quality.
503,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Ear buds,  Great gift.
504,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Great sound,"  I use it predominantly playing golf, which does stress the limits of the device. If I move too far from the iPhone it’s linked too, it’ll cut in and out, or off entirely. It’s not a fair criticism, but it’s my particular use. It’s also odd, when at a distance, the music will tune in and out depending on the position of my head while putting. Again, most people won’t care, but if Apple can improve this, it’ll probably help in other situations. Great sound otherwise and the earbuds are very comfortable over long usage spans."
505,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Great set of earbuds,  Great set of earbuds. Had a bit of an issue getting them connected to my iPhone 7 but once connected no further issues.  Having a wired charging case is not an issue.
506,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Hands Free Talk and Music,  I absolutely love these earbuds.  This is actually my 2nd pair.  My first pair was about 3 years old and the battery life was going down a bit.  I decided to buy another set.  I LOVE how long the battery time is and how fast they recharge.
507,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Worth it,  I love them. Easy to connect and use. The battery life is AMAZING. Definitely worth the buy.
508,"September 13, 2020",1.0,Do not buy!,  Do not buy . One AirPod doesn’t work after a month. Bought AppleCare and can’t even get them fixed or replaced.
509,"September 13, 2020",5.0,"GET it , Get It , Get It","  I love it !! Thank you , they sound great !! But I’m a little confused cus I ordered the 1st AirPods and they have me 2nd generation with wireless charging case .. ?"
510,"September 13, 2020",5.0,Real Apple Airpods,"  I know some people were concerned that this was a knockoff product, but it was not. I received the Airpods in original Apple packaging with serial number. I am very happy with my purchase as it was exactly what I expected. Good wireless headphones for everyday use that transfers with easy between my many Apple products (MacBook, iPad, and iPhone). That's easily the best part for me, their smooth integration with all other Apple products. They are not the top of the line wireless headphones for sound quality and features, if that is what you're looking for, but perfect for my daily use."
511,"September 13, 2020",3.0,The size was too big for my ears.,  There should be different sizes for those of us whose ears are small.
512,"September 13, 2020",1.0,Poor Design,  When you buy an Apple product you pay a premium price and with that comes the expectation that the product will work. What one does not expect is that upon unboxing the AirPods you find that they won’t connect and after 30 minutes of searching you find that ONE AirPods firmware is outdated and there is no way to manually update it. It is a poor design on the part of Apple and I would not recommend this product to anyone. Apple is slipping and it shows in their products.

I returned them and received a new pair.  That was fine, but now after the return period is over the new pair sent to me are no longer working.  We have tried everything.  I am so upset I spent so much money on these for them not to work and I can't even return them.Do not buy Apple Airpods.  The return policy is terrible if they stop working."

543,"September 11, 2020",5.0,Good battery life,  Got these for my sons birthday they work beautifully as I’m left in peace now. 👍
544,"September 11, 2020",2.0,Only last a handful of months before problems.,"  I use these for high intensity, sweaty exercise almost every day. I’ve bought these twice. They are great for a few months and then quickly deteriorate to the point where one or both will not charge. You think they are charging based on the indicator light but you’ll be disappointed to find one didn’t connect and charge up. Then, there’s a feature where when you flip open the lid case, a dialogue box pops open on your iPhone and displays the charging levels of each AirPod and the case. That feature will begin to stop working over time as well for no apparent reason. I would not spend so much money on these and go with a half price competitor if I can’t expect these to last more than 4-5 months."
545,"September 11, 2020",3.0,Not as happy as I wish I was,  I purchased my first airpods. I have already had to replace one ear piece.  Now I have to get both ear pieces replaced.

555,"September 11, 2020",5.0,Authentic AirPods,  I love these AirPods I was skeptical because I was buying from amazon but I know someone who works in the Apple store and they verified the authenticity of them for me. I even got the Apple care which they said was a great idea especially since I loose things a lot lol. Would recommend
556,"September 11, 2020",5.0,My best friend,  I love it thank you so much 😊
557,"September 11, 2020",3.0,"Nice quality, short battery life.","  I wish I knew how long the batteries would last.  Like in real life situation. I’m disappointed in how quick the AirPods die, but I guess being an Apple product, I shouldn’t entirely be surprised.  But they are really good when they are working."
558,"September 11, 2020",5.0,Perfect and simple to use,  I just love ever About apple and this orei e just choked me up ( in a good way) haha
559,"September 11, 2020",5.0,Perfect for my walks!,"  I had to talk myself into buying these, but I'm so glad I did now.  I was using regular Apple ear buds but they kept wanting to come out of my ears when I was on my walks because the cord would move.  These are perfect!"

567,"September 10, 2020",1.0,"Great, but fail if you sweat. 3 out of 3 pairs failed.","  On my third pair of AirPods. I LOVE them when they work, but if you run in the summer (and sweat), they will fail. This latest version failed much quicker (4 months). If you use these for running I would look elsewhere."
568,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Great choice. Love the air pods,  Perfect and easy to connect. So far positive all the way!
569,"September 10, 2020",4.0,Almost seamless integration,"  I'm cheap. This was in large part why I resisted shelling out the money for these. Consequently, I tried several other Bluetooth earbuds, several on the decidedly cheap end of the scale. One of the problems I experience is finding earbuds that fit my ears. I have very small ear canals, so the earbuds that have the cone shape tip that fits into the ear canal either just won't fit, or are extremely painful after a short time. The only shape I've found that actually works for me are these, which I discovered with the first pair of wired Apple earbuds that came with a new iPhone several versions back.I included this picture, which shows the Airpods on the left and the much cheaper knock-off I tried. I thought I'd be okay with the shape of the cheap ones, but as you can see, they are actually much larger than the Airpods, so they were frequently falling out of my ears, especially when I was doing any physical activity.So, I bit the bullet and shelled out for the OGs. Here's my take:Pros:-Integration with other Apple products. I have an iPhone, iPad and Apple watch and these work quite seamlessly unlike any others I've tried. I put ""almost"" in the title because I'm sure it will be improved on in further versions, I'm just not sure how. Oh, and I've never used ""Hey Siri"" as much as I do with these. I love being able to adjust the volume (among other commands) hands free. True story: Yesterday I was riding a scooter home from work, and not wanting to remove either hand from the handlebars, I wanted to use Siri to increase the volume. There was enough ambient downtown noise that Siri was having trouble hearing me, so as I was tootling down the busy city street I was saying ""Hey Siri"" repeatedly at increasing volume, until I was shouting it. Not one of my finer moments...-The fit (see above)-Quick charging. I will have something to say about the battery life in Cons, but one saving grace is that they charge remarkably fast. I do a lot of work from my computer (like a lot of others during the time of COVID), so I appreciate being able to get a quick charge on them between meetings.-Sound quality. I am not an audiophile, so my opinion here is very pedestrian, but they seem to have a good dynamic range. I've been blown away by the bass response coming out of such a small thing.Cons:-They still are not very secure in my ears. I suppose that could be more my issue than the Airpods, but I did have to buy an aftermarket accessory kit that included the silicone tips with wings and a silicone lanyard. Sometimes I commute to work on an electric scooter, and if it weren't for those (particularly the lanyard) I would have dropped one of them in the street multiple times. Sometimes I walk over a grate in the street and have a brief moment of fear that one will pop out of my ear and through the grate. With my luck, it isn't so much an issue of ""if"", but ""when"". (Side Note: if Apple doesn't sell replacements individually, they should)-Battery life. I figure I get about 2 hours of active use, which is fine and I think what they advertise. The curious thing is that the two discharge at very different rates. I'm trying to keep track so I can take them into our local Apple store and ask about it, but it is odd, and I have seen other reviews that also noted that issue.Overall, I give them 2 thumbs up!"
570,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Just get the AirPods,"  Did you know AirPods work with androids? It works just like any other Bluetooth device.My hubby doesn’t like the gummy kind of wireless earphone.

573,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Android phone,  They were easy to pair with  my Samsung S10
574,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Comparing airpods to the AirPods Pro,"  Bought a few as gifts for myself and others, along with a few AirPods Pro. Having tried both at the same time, I found that these work just as well when it comes to the sound quality, although I find the fit on the Pro to be better so the experience might be better For some. The noise cancellation/transparency  Modes on  the Pros seem to be the biggest differential."

576,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Perfect Gift for Spouse,"  I got these as a birthday gift for my wife. I don’t know how good they sound because I haven’t ever used them, but I do know that she’s worn them pretty much 24/7 since getting them, so they must be pretty good. 5 stars for making a product that guarantees to make your wife/partner/significant other forget that you exist!"
577,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Muy buen producto
578,"September 10, 2020",4.0,Awesome!,  The sound is great but the case is so slippery that I accidentally dropped it into the garbage and it got covered with peanut butter! Even the connecting port! I cleaned it off with some rubbing alcohol and it still works. I think it should come with a pair of ear hooks because they fall out of my ears while I am cleaning my home.
579,"September 10, 2020",5.0,Great product!,  After seeing some comments about it being fake I can safely say that it is not fake. I love the quality of the audio! This is a good option if you want to save money instead of buying it from apple.
580,"September 10, 2020",1.0,One of my ear buds didn't work,  When I got the EarPods one did not work

582,"September 10, 2020",5.0,love,  love
583,"September 10, 2020",4.0,Use them more than I thought I would. Falling out is an issue.,"  I am using these more than I thought I would after a year, but it's more for at home or work listening and less active listening as they fall out too easily from my ears. I've had some mad under the plane seat scrambling when they fell out often on plane journeys and now in these COVID times I want to avoid that.I have some other Bang and Olufsen Beoplay wireless earbuds that are double the price of Airpods and their sound is wonderful, they are also noise canceling and fit better in the ears. But I use the AirPods a bit more everywhere due to the seamless pairing with iPhone or iPad without having to open up settings. The bass is punchier on Airpods compared to B&O although the overall sound is better on B&O. The one issue I had at work was the no one could see the black B&O earbuds in my ears and they would start speaking to me and I had no clue as they were noise cancelling. Airpods are much more visible in my ears. The one thing I did like about B&O earbuds that you could just tap them to turn of noise canceling and then it magnified the sounds around you, so I could even hear conversations further away. These Airpods have some degree of noise cancellation but not a whole lot.I wish the fit was better for more active situations. I constantly drop them if I put them on in the gym so I just use wireless earphones with a neckband. But they are ok at home if I just want to chat with someone on the phone and don't want them to hear external noises if I am cooking. They're also good for bed when I want to listen to some meditations before going to sleep but don't want to wake anyone. I bought them on a whim and have used them quite a bit. They burn my ears after an hour or two so I can't wear them for prolonged periods. For a more comfortable fit for long journeys I bring my Bang and Olufsen Beoplays. For the gym I bring along cheap $40 wireless earbuds that have a pumped up base and sound good for the gym.Overall, I will say that for the price they offer good sound and value."

These AirPods are the real Apple (made in Vietnam) product and came sealed in their APPLE certified packaging with warrantee papers (1 year) and instructions. I paired and tested the AirPods with both my iPhone and my Windows 10 PC - easy to figure out based on the instructions included. Great high fidelity sound quality and they are so comfortable, I forget about them. I walk most days while listening to NPR news radio or Amazon music. I also watch news and movies on my PC in my room on Apple wired earphones - but I think I'll switch to using the AirPods from now on. These are perfect for my needs.

665,"September 6, 2020",5.0,Buy from here,"  Great item, the seller was quick with shipping as"
666,"September 6, 2020",2.0,Had to return... don’t by used!,  Bought “like new” to save a few bucks. Came with earwax all over them and the left one not working. Just buy them new😂
667,"September 6, 2020",1.0,Defective,  Not working.
668,"September 6, 2020",5.0,Can’t beat ‘em,  Fully workable
669,"September 6, 2020",1.0,Just Trash,  Awful issues connecting to the Iphone. My car and other bluetooth devices are fine. However these POS always have to be reconnected only one will work at a time. All these issues started magically happening when the Pros came out. I suppose its Apple up to their usual tricks of making older products not work to push the new model.
670,"September 6, 2020",5.0,BEST PURCHASE YET on amazon. How did I live without these for so long.,"  Been waiting and contemplating for a long time on whether to spend more than $100 on wireless AirPods. After tripping on my headphone cable and having my phone almost fall into a creek, I decided to take the leap. DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY DIME. Battery life is incredible. Even more incredible is the time the AirPods take to recharge once you put them to charge in the charged case. Holy super speed charging. It literally feels like it takes less than 2 to 3 minutes to charge them from 10% to 100%. Best product I have purchased on Amazon so far. Also, I would highly recommend buying a case for your AirPods as soon as you get them. I chose the cartoon looking deadpool and I couldn’t be happier."
671,"September 6, 2020",5.0,Recommend,  I bought as a Christmas present for my Goddaughter and she love them! She uses them almost everyday and likes that it hooks to her phone wirelessly.
672,"September 6, 2020",5.0,So happy with my purchase!,"  Just received my new pair. I had a pair of AirPods but unfortunately left them in my pants pocket..and they went through a wash cycle. So I went on amazon to see about buying a new pair. My old pair was free (since I got a new iPad through Apple) but this pair was $136 with tax. I was definitely hesitant to buy these from amazon because of some of the reviews but I’m here to say these are AWESOME. They are legit Apple AirPods and they’re cheaper on amazon! The one on the left is my old pair and the new ones are on the right. There is no difference. Take it from me, you won’t regret it. Just make sure to check your pockets ALWAYS. They are not water proof and the advice Apple gave me did not work for the old ones (leave it out for 24 hours). Good investment if you listen to music a lot, make calls, like the convenience of no cords. Just be careful because it’s a lot of money to lose if you have no AppleCare. Even with AppleCare there are still fees to replace them."
673,"September 6, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  Great Sound, Battery life .."
674,"September 6, 2020",5.0,Great product as expected from apple,  Great product! I bought a cheap set first just to see if I would like the wireless option and I really did so I went for a nice pair. The sound quality is great and was better than cheaper options. I also bought a strap set for when I go bike riding in the mornings and they work great!
675,"September 6, 2020",1.0,Poor quality on charging,"  This is the 2nd time I bought it,  either of those lasted more than 2 month.  One of the ear pod just couldn’t get charged after few uses."
676,"September 6, 2020",1.0,No Product,  I received a box with no headphones. upsetting
677,"September 6, 2020",5.0,Still the best out there,"  These are far more comfortable than the new ""pro"" version. The sound quality is excellent. The one thing new buyers need to know is that they last about two years. Then the batteries die, and are not replaceable. As long as you know that going in and are okay with it, you should be satisfied."
678,"September 6, 2020",5.0,great sound,  Have used for 1 year and love them
679,"September 6, 2020",4.0,Great headphones,"  I've always liked Apple's products, and I'm not disappointed this time"
680,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Most reliable,  Typical Apple greatness.
681,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Get a case these things are slippery lol,  Loved the item and the price!
682,"September 5, 2020",3.0,Pros and cons...,"  I’m very happy with the battery life, the short period of time required to get a full charge, the noise cancellation and the sound quality as well. I took away a star based on the fact that they don’t always connect to the phone for use nor to read the battery life left on the charger box and AirPods. In addition, and more importantly, I can’t help but to notice that I get extreme migraines when I’ve used them and it’s always on the side that I used them on."
683,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Perfect for an 11 year old,  My Granddaughter was excited to them and had not had a problem!
684,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Great battery life!!,  I love my AirPods!! I use them while mowing the lawn and my singing app!!
685,"September 5, 2020",5.0,GREAT SOUND!,  I'MI THROUGHLY ENJOYING  THE APPLE AIRPODS.  THE CLARITY OF AUDIBLE BOOKS I HEARD DAILY IS STUPENDOUS.
686,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Arrived on time. Just as described.
687,"September 5, 2020",5.0,It pays to buy the very best!,"  Don't be fooled by imitations. This is the best. I highly recommend you purchase these airpods.  You won't regret them. Price was right at $129. They are best for a reason, the are the BEST!"
688,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Typical Apple quality,  Works as good as any Apple product
689,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Work well hold charge. Charge quickly.,  I love these. Perfect for practicing fiddle with asd.
690,"September 5, 2020",5.0,GREAT!,  We have 4 of these in the house. They are all great. Sound is great. Just don't lose them kids!
691,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Lives up to the name,"  They are great! When I picked them up they were on sale, so I said why not. I wanted to get a better pair of wireless earbuds (as my last ones were garbage), and these were much better. If you use apple products I would highly recommend."
692,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Amazing 🙌🏼,   So excited to enjoy them and they came 3 days early
693,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Ships in fast so don’t pay for shipping,  I love everything it all works
694,"September 5, 2020",5.0,7/10,  Very comfortable in the ear and great at canceling out noise not sure if this is with all heard phones but only thing to complain about is whenever Listening to music there is a faint Annoying tapping sound?
695,"September 5, 2020",1.0,Listen to the bad reviews! - POOR MIC QUALITY,"  Do you want your friends / co-workers clients constantly telling you that your microphone sounds awful and that they can't hear you? Then these are the headphones for you! What a waste of money, time and effort. I don't know how they can get away with selling these things and how they're reviewed well at all. What a headache."

699,"September 5, 2020",5.0,My daughter loves them,  My daughter put them in when she got them and takes them out only to shower and sleep.
700,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Authentic AirPods,  They came a day ahead of schedule and they were exactly what I was looking for !
701,"September 5, 2020",5.0,nice,  nothing
702,"September 5, 2020",5.0,My wife loves them!,  I bought these AirPods for my wife for her birthday. She absolutely loves them and has no complaints. She really appreciated the fact that pairing them to her phone was super easy by just holding them next to the phone. It’s made her work and grad school calls / zoom sessions a lot better! Great design and functionality.
703,"September 5, 2020",5.0,Won’t regret going t.,  Great buy!
704,"September 4, 2020",1.0,Bad batch,  They’re just okay. Maybe mine are defective? Poor quality.
705,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Good,"  My brother has been asking for Airpods forever, he was excited to finally get some. They work as expected with his iPhone 11."
706,"September 4, 2020",3.0,They stopped working,"  So I got these Airpods as a gift, but the left bud stopped working somehow? I never dropped or did any damage to them. It just stopped working completely. But for the time I had them, they were great I think. Just sad that I have to buy a brand new pair...."
707,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Awesome product,  I bought these as a b-day present for my wife and she absolutely loves them.
708,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Very Happy,  Love my IPODS.
709,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Its great,  Its great
710,"September 4, 2020",3.0,There good but....,  They were good for about 3 months but then the right pod lost sound not completely but it is rly low I don’t know what happened
711,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Hearing the music,  I like the sound quality
712,"September 4, 2020",3.0,Only fits in ears that are perfect,  My right ear is very sore from these and I decided for no choice to return them. I love them but I need comfort to use them and they always came out of my ears many times.
713,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Happy with quality and sound,  I like everything about these air pods. They work very well.
714,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Great Quality!,  They were exactly what I expected! Fast shipping and great quality
715,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Granddaughter loves them
716,"September 4, 2020",3.0,Good only with iPhone,"  Good if you have iPhone. I was told that the volume, start/ stop, song change controls worked with android phones but they don't. I returned it for that reason and got the Samsung Buds Live, they are your best choice with Android."
717,"September 4, 2020",1.0,The Left Ear Bud is not working,"  I purchased this for my boyfriend as a Birthday Gift and just one month later, the Left Ear Bud died and won't play or connect. I am very upset that this happened a few days after the return date. I paid a lot of money for the following item and cannot get any help to fix or replace it. I am very disappointed since I purchased a qty. 2 of over $300 (+) dollars."
718,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Good product and worth the price,"  I needed some wireless headphones and I am worried about the cheaper wireless headsets. So I went with a product I know would check most of the boxes. They have good sound quality. You can change what tapping the headphones do which is awesome. But also at my work, if someone is trying to talk to me, I can take an ear bud out and it pauses what is playing and as soon as I put the headphone back in, it plays what I was playing. I have an iPhone 11 Pro and these have worked perfectly."
719,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Amazing product to get!,  Love love love it!!! Awesome sound and great battery life!
720,"September 4, 2020",4.0,Needs waterproofing,  The battery life could be better. Also I wish they were waterproof. They are kind of expensive for what you get.
721,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Better then Ordering Thru Phone Service,  Should of gotten a protection plan bc my dog chewed my right pod jus a week of purchase but thankfully they sell them single on here as well. Came right on time and have no complaints !
722,"September 4, 2020",5.0,So so,  Mine crackle when I listen
723,"September 4, 2020",5.0,A must have for very active people.,  I am so very pleased with these Airpods. Goo sound and offered up my hands to continue with MANY tasks.
724,"September 4, 2020",1.0,BE AWARE!!! Not AUTHENTIC !!!😡,"  This product was knock off .. NOT AUTHENTIC AIRPODS... Called verified with APPLE direct customer service.. serial and model number all invalid.. Also, ifYou look at The photo of the Authentic has the line around the ear piece and the knock off ear piece does not...  please, verify your purchases with APPLE... there is so much scamming going on today and it’s not worth losing your Hard earned money for knock off..  I REPEAT VERIFY WITH APPLE!!!😡"
725,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Easy to use.,  Great product and excellent service. Thank you.
726,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  Great headphones
727,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  Air buds taste is really good almost better than my original. it came already charged which is great and it fits mypods perfectly this is an amazing replacement
728,"September 4, 2020",5.0,Way better than the wired kind,"  Great product. Got tired of the wired ones because the wire kept breaking on me from heavy use and decided on investing in these. Works well, and are the real deal because I saw a few reviews saying they were fakes. They are 100% real, box came sealed in plastic and sound about the same as the wired ones."
729,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  They are awesome!
730,"September 3, 2020",1.0,Stopped working after a month!,  I’ve had these for a little over a month now and one of the AirPods already stopped working. And of course the window for returns was only 30 days so basically I spent all that money for a product that I maybe used 20 times. Save your money and just go to Target or AT&T. Or better yet spend a little more at the Apple store. At least there you get a 90 day warranty.
731,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Fantastic authentic Apple product.,  Sound quality is excellent. Paired instantly with my iPhone 11. This technology is remarkable. I bought this from amazon warehouse. It was unopened in excellent condition. Works perfectly with my refurbished iPhone 11 from amazon which was also in excellent condition. Thanks
732,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Great Quality,  Real deal! easy to connect and is great quality ! would recommend!
733,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Amazing!!!,  I was really on the fence whether or not to get these and I can say I am incredibly happy with my purchase I use them every day both at work For business meetings and at home listening to Spotify while cooking dinner and they have never fail to amaze! I found out I could hook them up to my television via Bluetooth as well so I can have the experience of walking in the door after work turning on the TV and it immediately starts playing on the AirPods that are already in my ears.
734,"September 3, 2020",1.0,Very bad mic quality,"  Checked the serial number on Apple’s website and it says these are legit. But wonder if I got some counterfeits. Why do people say these are so good. The audio quality is horrible compared to the plug in airbuds that you get with your iPhone. And the voice quality is abysmal. I got these specifically for Zoom and Teams calls on my Mac book and people say they can barely hear me. I make calls from my iPhone XS with these and the same issue. I got on sale for $130 but that is till to much for these useless headphones.  Going back to the free plug in ear buds.  Also, they say 5 hours of battery life. But if you use for talk you only get 2 hours. I am in meetings all day. Useless."
735,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Nice.,"  Apple EarPods, what else to say... easy to use, connects without any issues. Battery last longer than I thought it would."
736,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Not worth it,  This the 2 time I have replaced is not worth it
737,"September 3, 2020",2.0,got it with big scratch,  nice visible scratch on the right airpod!!! wasn't expecting this on a NEW product!!!!!!
738,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  Good quality
739,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Easy to use,  Perfect
740,"September 3, 2020",1.0,Filthy,  It came filthyI wouldn’t take it even if I get it for free
741,"September 3, 2020",1.0,These are used Airpods,"  I can't comment on whether these are authentic as some other people were wondering in their comments but I can say that the pair I received was used.  When I first connected them to my phone they connected as ""Big _______ Juan's Airpods"".  I won't write what the word is that I left out but I guess Juan was proud of himself...I can't see anywhere in the listing that it says that these Airpods were used so that is pretty frustrating.  Are they all refurbished?  Just feel misled."
742,"September 3, 2020",5.0,My kids love them,  This is the third pair we have in the family. My  kids love them
743,"September 3, 2020",1.0,Air pods won't connect,"  The most horrible experience, I bought these for my girlfriend and she was excited to try them and then I tried to pair them to her phone and they wont connect at all or even show up the animation screen of the airpods on her i phone, i looked up online and it said that the previous user has to forget the device from their phone in order to pair to a new phone, and we can not or Amazon contact the pervious user to get that done, so when asked for my options, I could of eaither get a replacement which I'm hoping won't be the same thing or a refund but I have to send back the headphones but I don't have much time due to work at the moment, so that is what I'm stuck with unfortunately so I just asked for a replacement at the moment, so disappointed in this product"
744,"September 3, 2020",1.0,Pieces of junk,"  Didn’t even last 2 years. Battery case went out in less than a year after purchase. Apple store replaced the case since it was within the 1 year warranty, about 5 months later the left pod died.  Shortly after the right one. Don’t waste your money, unless you get the Apple Care for 2 years, you’d have to shell out $90 to have either pod replaced, glad I didn’t since the right one died so soon after the left one did. Pieces of junk!!"
745,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Just what I needed!
746,"September 3, 2020",5.0,They’re great! Came on time!,  I love them ! Nice packaging.
747,"September 3, 2020",1.0,ONE POD STOP WORKING,  ONE POD STOP WORKING
748,"September 3, 2020",5.0,A great shopping excricen,  It was a great shopping and I like the design. My son also liked it very much. He gave him a set of shopping experience behind his back. It was a great shopping experience!!!!
749,"September 3, 2020",5.0,U get what u pay for when u are satisfied,  My kid loves themThe price was a lot but I could have got the cheaper ones and he would hate them so worth this kids birthday present 🥺🤣😎By the way I did by the cheap ones and I do t even lime them so pay for the quality! Learned my lesson 😟
750,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Don’t buy this from amazon,  I did not like the service that I had it was horrible and the box was beat up when I got it I didn’t like it at all.!!
751,"September 3, 2020",5.0,They seem perfect,  They came in a sealed box and work good so far
752,"September 3, 2020",4.0,Excelente,  muy buena calidad
753,"September 3, 2020",1.0,One bad apple 🍎,  Defective product I have low hearing and it took me a while to figure Out that It was the product.
754,"September 3, 2020",5.0,Great!!,  Love
755,"September 2, 2020",5.0,"Real good ass AirPods, I’m extremely happy","  I was super hesitant because I had a problem with Lasership before but they ACTUALLY DELIVERED my AirPods and it’s real asfff, ain’t nothing fake or broken or messed up about it👏🏾The money is worth it y’all ‼️"
756,"September 2, 2020",5.0,The overall feeling is very high-end,"  The overall feeling is very high-end. The appearance looks exquisite and compact, easy to carry, good handle. The sound quality is also good. Bluetooth connection is direct and simple, and the left and right ears can be connected without picking edges. I love this baby!"
757,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Wonderful discovery!,  I am very impressed with this product. I love that I am able to only use one at a time while at work or doing other things. I also like the fact that the outer case holds a charge and it doesn’t drain fast at all and then it charges them when you put them back in. They fit perfectly in my ears. I have not dropped them or have them fall out while doing things such as cleaning or doing anything physical.
758,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Smexy,"  I’m a big apple fan and this works perfect for me. It came two days early and it works perfect, amazing ‼️‼️"
759,"September 2, 2020",1.0,Don’t waste your coins,  I get 2 hours MAX of listening timeAnd 1 hr talk time. Complete waste of money
760,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Llegó rápido y excelente productor,  Buen artículo llegó en perfecta condiciones u rapido
761,"September 2, 2020",1.0,Disappointing,  I am so sad.  I bought these in January and I’ve used them less than ten times because the right AirPod doesn’t even work and the case itself doesn’t hold a charge for more than a day.  I would’ve returned them however the window to do so has closed.  What a waste of money.
762,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Great buy!,"  I’ve had these for about a month so far and they’ve held up. I like that they instantly pair up with your phone (iPhone) as soon as you take them out of the case. The sound is good, obviously not as great as other brands but it will be sufficient for my needs. The battery is quite long. In general I think the price and the product is good."
763,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Never leave home with out this!,"  This was one of the best purchases I've made.  Super easy to use and works very well.  No static at all, good sound quality."
764,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Cool kid,  No more leash
765,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Very comfortable,  Love them!
766,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Get them,  Loud I love apple
767,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Great,  It is a great product! I use them all the time! Good quality
768,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Lovable,  I love my AirPods
769,"September 2, 2020",1.0,Stopped working one month after purchase,  Very frustrating that these airpods stopped working one month after purchase.
770,"September 2, 2020",5.0,rocks !,  love it works awesome and it is easy to wear!
771,"September 2, 2020",2.0,Very unreliable,"  After the first 3 months or so, I had continual problems. One earbud wouldn't charge, issues connecting even after restarting. One day they would be working fine then the next morning I'd find that even though being plugged in all night, neither the case nor the buds had charged."
772,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Amazon did not honor free music trial and buds not suitable for gardening,"  This is obviously a great product to use when on the phone. However, I was tempted by these to listen to music whilst weeding without having to carry the iphone around.  I should have done more research.  The range is a few feet, farther than that and the music just cuts in and out.  The buds also don't stay in my ears as I move.  Back to the shuffle and headphones I guess.  My biggest gripe was that I never received the e-mail to start a free music trial. I contacted Amazon three different times and their customer service was awful. They claimed they couldn't see the deal on the product page-even had me send screen shots to prove it.  Made me feel like I was lying to them.  The deal is still there!!  They never got back to me."
773,"September 2, 2020",1.0,They work for a little But not long,  I had them for maybe two months and now they disconnect randomly and don’t produce any sound extremely upset at the quality
774,"September 2, 2020",5.0,What's there to say?,"  I waited to review this product until I had had them for a while so I could assess their longevity. These airpods have been glued to my ears for the past 13 months or so. I would conservatively estimate that I use them for at least 30 hours a week. They've lasted me through countless Zoom meetings, long walks through the park, and study sessions. Even though I'm one of those people who's a total sucker for Apple products, it took me a while to bite the bullet and get these. My advice: do it! I haven't regretted it."
775,"September 2, 2020",1.0,Overpriced,"  You bought Apple, you know what you're getting into."
776,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Works and came charged,  came 75% charged and the volume is perfect. I recommend as they are super simple to use
777,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Open Box & Perfect!!,"  These headphones arrived in mint condition, new packaging and sound great!! Glad I decided to buy them!"
778,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Muy bien,  Excelente
779,"September 2, 2020",2.0,Very frustrating to use,"  Theyre great when they work, which is rare. Im sure im a special case here, but my airpods very often will not work, they pair just fine but will very often randomly disconnect or not play any sound. Sometimes only one will work. Sound quality is pretty decent, battery is good but the actual case is always dead it seems. This is by far the most frustrating product ive spent money on in terms of technology. I will be changing to either the airpods pro or a set of Sony headphones."
780,"September 2, 2020",5.0,Worth it!,  Bought these for my sister and she loves them!
781,"September 2, 2020",1.0,A little disappointed but it turned out okay in the end.,"  Unfortunately, I had to request a refund because the AirPods would not connect to any of my devices. I thought that I could save a few bucks by purchasing the AirPods that were used but in good condition as they were supposed to be verified to work but this wasn’t the case. I ended up requesting a refund on the used pair and ordering AirPods that were brand new on the same night. The brand new pair worked great. Fortunately, even if you buy the “used in good condition” ones that are verified by the seller and they do not work the return/refund process was very easy."
782,"September 1, 2020",1.0,Not worth it,  One of my AirPods stopped working when I got it
783,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Useful for meetings,"  I got these since I now have a bunch of Zoom meetings, and they work perfectly! Good battery life and charges quickly so I can quickly recharge before meeting if I've been using them. Mic and sound quality are both good too."
784,"September 1, 2020",5.0,WORTH THE PURCHASE,"  Arrived in a timely manner with Prime. Professional, clean packaging. Works perfectly."
785,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  Amazing!!
786,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Great for multitasking on long calls working from home,  Game changer for working at home now with so many conference calls and video meetings daily. With seamless pairing to Apple devices and the ability to walk around the house and multitask while doing business. These are great. Just mad I waited so long to buy them. Audio quality is very good. These not ‘noise canceling’ ear buds but at medium volume they are great for sitting in the office for long calls or Great for hands free driving.
787,"September 1, 2020",2.0,The product was wrong,  I like Apple AirPods. I don’t like ordering a 2nd generation set of AirPods and receiving a first generation set of AirPods.. The case for the first generation of AirPods is under the lid. The case for the 2nd generation is on the outside.
788,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Excellent product,  Fantastic product
789,"September 1, 2020",4.0,Great for virtual teaching but expect to charge between classes.,  I’m a teacher using these for virtual learning. The sound and mic quality is great!  The battery life has been a little disappointing. Maybe I should only use one at a time. I have to charge both in between classes.
790,"September 1, 2020",1.0,Don’t Buy!!,  I bought 2 sets & they are horrible. One pod never charges/ the light on the case is flaky- no light/ green light when it should be charging etc. I have followed the troubleshooting directions & nothing works. I am 1 day late in being able to return them & from what I have read in previous reviews- Apple charged $69 to repair- what a ripoff!! Do not recommend
791,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Great sound,  Very good sounding air pods I bought for myself now my wife wants a pair too
792,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Get yours now!,  Perfect! As described!
793,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Sound quality,  That work great
794,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Yes,  Love it
795,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Love them,  These are my second pair. I tried others after I lost my first BC they are expensive but nothing compares
796,"September 1, 2020",5.0,WORTH THE MONEY,"  These are awesome. They are authentic and comfortable, the sync well and the sound and bass are good. The batter life is a little small, you need to plug them in every night (they can't last more than 8 hours) but the charging case can hold a charge for days which is awesome."
797,"September 1, 2020",4.0,"Good sound, comfortable easy setup.","  Quite happy with the sound and really like the case.  Biggest issue I have is they don't always automatically connect.  Seems to be no rhyme or reason to the automatic connect.  It's easy to manually connect them, but I expected better."
798,"September 1, 2020",5.0,I love my AirPods!!,  I love my AirPods!!!!
799,"September 1, 2020",5.0,*****,  Perfect! *****
800,"September 1, 2020",5.0,BATTERY,  These are awesome. Can go through about 3 to 4 days without charging them with spontaneous use.
801,"September 1, 2020",5.0,very good,  very good
802,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Great product and does do noise cancellation.  Very little background noise

806,"September 1, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy,"  Words cannot describe how disappointing these AirPods are, but I’ll tryOne of them is always deadThe case doesn’t chargeThey don’t connect to my phone"
807,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Reviews,   The packaging is legit I saw some reviews saying it was just a empty box and a charger which kind of scared me when I purchased but it came a day early came with a charger and instructions and came with the air pods of course so far I do enjoy them
808,"September 1, 2020",5.0,I love my iPad thanks you guys,  I love my iPad thanks you guys
809,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Quality,  Sound quality is very good

811,"September 1, 2020",5.0,Wireless Connection,"  This apple airpods with charging box automatically turns on and connects automatically, providing a faster wireless connection for your new headset."
812,"August 31, 2020",4.0,Good product,  The product works well. Got them for my bf. He did say there was a few times where the pods wouldn’t connect with the phone. But over all good!
813,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Clarity is outstanding,  Sound
814,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Love this item,  Currently very happy with purchase!
815,"August 31, 2020",1.0,Dirty & disgusting!!,  Dirty & disgusting!! Full of ear wax and dirt some boxes came open. Don’t buy stay away!!
816,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Long lasting charge and great quality,"  Excellent sound quality, easy to link to your Apple device."
817,"August 31, 2020",2.0,Airpods are Great But...,"  These were fantastic and a game changer for me for the first few months. But the left pod stopped working recently. I've tried everything. From checking out message boards online to reading other reviews and looking for similar issues. It was a quick progression. First it took a while for the left to connect. Then it just stopped working no matter what. Shows up as green, 100% battery but still no sound ever comes out of it. Otherwise, I'd recommend AirPods to anyone with Apple devices as they are smart, sleek and convenient. Guess I just got a bad individual product. Probably should have gone directly through Apple for something like this just to be safe."
818,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Quality is great,  I love them! Quick shipper
819,"August 31, 2020",5.0,They’re good,  Good aipods

823,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Great seller! 😊 Would buy from them again! 👍👍,  Love them!!! 😊 Great price and fast delivery! 😊
824,"August 31, 2020",2.0,Product came in defective (left AirPod made no audio),"  Don’t get me wrong airpods are great , I use my girlfriend’s airpods all the time, because of it I decided to buy my own, long story short the airpods came in broken , the left earpiece wasn’t working and I looked it up and it seems to be a common mistake , but after days of trying to fix it I came to a conclusion that it just doesn’t work, so I had to return and now I’m going to buy the pros to avoid situations like this ."
825,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Wish I'd bought them earlier,"  I like almost everything about the AirPods except for the fit in my right ear.Otherwise they are the best Bluetooth earphones I've used,"
826,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Great!,  I love these headphones! They were exactly what I ordered!
827,"August 31, 2020",1.0,"Don’t buy it, buy it ok apple website","  The first time, they sent me an empty box; the second time, they sent me a fake AirPods....I cannot say anything...I’m done with it"
828,"August 31, 2020",5.0,N/A,  To listen to music while at work and talk on the phone.
829,"August 31, 2020",5.0,"No complaints, esaier than going to apple store","  Thanks, no issues.  Love them and use them everyday."
830,"August 31, 2020",1.0,please dont...,"   Yes I know, Amazon is a cheaper and faster way to get your favorite Airpods. BUT please just go to nearest apple store or buy it from their main site because you might be the unlucky one getting defective airpods. Mine arrived but I could NEVER connect to a single device because the right earbud (shown on the video) is not recognized. So I cannot even begin the setup - which is easier part."
831,"August 31, 2020",3.0,They wont work for me.  Spending this kind of money they need to last a year at least.,  I own a lawn service and Mow grass all day long. I have used these everyday for about 4 months and now they're not even loud enough to hear and at fully charged. These will not be something that I will continue to buy every 4 months...on to the next brand.
832,"August 31, 2020",5.0,djddrjrj,  Great :)
833,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  Great Sound Quality and they fit in and wont fly out ears while working out. Battery isn't the greatest compared to Beats Solo3, But it lasts all day."
834,"August 31, 2020",1.0,AirPods detective,  Received the AirPods today and also returned them today. Left AirPod 100% charged and had absolutely NO SOUND. Right AirPod had sound but would not charge to 100%.
835,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Perfection,"  It’s overall perfection. It’s performance, sound system and battery life is outstanding"
836,"August 31, 2020",5.0,Think no further,"  I bought an off brand AirPod-like product & literally ended up purchasing the Apple AirPods within 30mins or receiving the knock-offs... but I did end up “gifting” the non-Apple pair to my brother in law, so went wellBuy. The. AirPods."
837,"August 31, 2020",5.0,La entrega muy rápida,  Buena calidad
838,"August 31, 2020",2.0,Mic Quality Degrades Over Time,"  If you're just using them for headphones, they're fine. However, over time the quality of the microphone degrades. Now people say it sounds like I'm talking to them at the end of a long hallway. All troubleshooting has led to nothing. I've since gone back to my Bose QC35s and rarely use these anymore."
839,"August 31, 2020",1.0,Bought these as a gift and I couldn't return after we found out right one doesn't work.,  Right ear bud doesn't work/won't hold the charge.
840,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Best of Bluetooth headphones,  Apple always wins for headphones. Nothing compares!
841,"August 30, 2020",3.0,Disappointed considering the cost,"  After spending this much money on AirPods, I am disappointed that they do not feel comfortable and the batteries do not last very long they need to be charged too frequently. I bought a cheaper pair that had rubber earpieces in three different sizes and they are actually more comfortable and last longer than the AirPods"
842,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Very good price for AirPods!,  Great price for an Apple product!  Awesome quality!
843,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Just buy them,  I went too long without them! BUT when you get them- mark the case some how do they are easier to find again.
844,"August 30, 2020",5.0,👍🏾,"  It’s Apple, what else do I have to say??😂😂"
845,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Great!,  I've had them for about a month! New and perfect! Great sound quality. Came in new unopened packaging. Also came with an adapter.
846,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Assuming they are amazing.,"  I'm writing this for my husband because I never see him without these in his ears. Makes me think they work well and that he loves them. I can't be certain though, as we haven't had a face to face conversation since they arrived 3 months ago. Is it weird that he only wants to talk on the phone now, so he doesn't have to take these off?"
847,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Confort,  Sonido bastante sólido y buen confort al momento de usarlos
848,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Apple makes good headphones,  Hands down best blue tooth headphones. I’m upgrading from A Bose system that stoped working after 2 years of use.
849,"August 30, 2020",5.0,100% Real!!,  This is the authentic thing. Worked out cheaper for me this way than ordering from Apple’s website.
850,"August 30, 2020",3.0,Work great but not 2nd gen.,"  My husband bought me these after I had purchased a cheap pair of Bluetooth headphones for talking and he couldn’t hear me. These have wonderful sound quality and he can hear me perfectly when we are talking on the phone. They charge great and the battery lasts me a while. I’m giving 3 stars because, while the headphones themselves are 2nd gen, the case is not."
851,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Great customer support,  Would have been 1 star I first ordered it pair was malfunctioning I called Apple support they said it was the AirPods I sent them back for a replacement and expedited it to me 10/10 would buy again for family.
852,"August 30, 2020",5.0,good,  they were and still are airpods and work like airpods are supposed to
853,"August 30, 2020",1.0,Horrible quality,"  Bought these for our teen daughter. The first pair glitched so badly when listening to anything, they were unusable so we exchanged them. The second pair is filthy. Totally disappointed in this item and will be returning AGAIN."
854,"August 30, 2020",4.0,Not bad,  At times one ear 👂 plug stop playing at times which is crazy to me but thats my thought.  To me they are vary comfortable and work great when talking on the ph.
855,"August 30, 2020",2.0,Sound quality,"  The sound quality was awful, I get better sound from my 10$ earbuds, was really disappointed."
856,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Awesome
857,"August 30, 2020",5.0,great quality air pods,  My family loves these air pods.  I have now bought three pairs for various members of my family.  They all love them and would not use anything else.  This is an excellent product.
858,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Can you Hear This,  Sound quality is awesome. Sounds perfect and they don’t hurt your ears. Battery life is about 5 hrs so you got to charge them up for a little while during the work day. Overall they are well worth the money. I use mine for work and I am on the phone 10 hrs a day. I highly recommend them..
859,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Amazing investment,  These were a great buy overall. Very helpful for online school and work.
860,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  I just received mine yesterday and they work really well. They charge super fast and the sound quality is great. Definitely going to have to buy another one

862,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Great sound quality
863,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Great!,  My husband lives them
864,"August 30, 2020",2.0,Not reliable!,  After two days of use they starting giving interference with camera and microphone started acting during talk. Had to return item.
865,"August 30, 2020",5.0,This product is very good,  This product is very good
866,"August 30, 2020",5.0,No more strings,"  Absolutely the best sound, since they invented stereo!! Blocks out noise, sounds excellent, charge stays long. I love them"
867,"August 30, 2020",5.0,Satisfied,  It reads received texts to me in my ear
868,"August 29, 2020",1.0,Unsatisfied,"  This was a terrible purchase. I am completely unsatisfied with this product as it has a terrible mix, has buzzing sounds from time to time and has a lot of search marks on the case. For the price it was definitely not worth it as I could’ve just bought a brand new pair from the store. I do not recommend anyone buying any product from whoever was selling this as it is a complete rip off. I hope the next person gets to see this before purchasing."
869,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Good audio,"  I like the mobility of the airpods. They live up to the hype. It is a well worth purchase, however, I bought some ear piece that holds the airpods when i workout because they fall out when I do that. overall very good though, just buy some accessories and it is a well worth purchase."
870,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Sleek and cool looking.,  They are top of the line. Excellent device and the price point is spot on.
871,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Keep the case charged,  The battery life isn’t long enough for a full shift at work
872,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Great product,  These are wonderful!!!  Our teenager loves them!
873,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Good value,  Kids in hog heaven with them so far no issues after one month

875,"August 29, 2020",4.0,Excellent buy.,  Excellent buy.
876,"August 29, 2020",5.0,"comfortable, great sound",  Excellent sound - excellent quality - love them. Saying goodbye to my generic Bluetooth subpar ones.
877,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Worked Great,  They worked fine until the teenager lost them.  Common story ?
878,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Nice item.,  Good item.
879,"August 29, 2020",3.0,Decent,  Left AirPod stopped working
880,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Easy and sound great,  Easy to pair. Sound great. Typical apple product
881,"August 29, 2020",3.0,"All around gets the job done, but dies out",  It’s ok in the beginning. Although even from the start there is no noise cancellation not even passive noise canceling (ear buds) and they slip out if you have them on for a few hours. The sound quality to me is ok I guess? It does sound good but not exactly great. But the main problem with these truly witless earbuds is that they lose sound after only about three months of having them. I try my hardest to keep my ears clean while having them in and I also kinda quickly clean them afterwards with like my shirt but they are so silent now I can’t even take them to the gym. Although they’re mostly meant for casual use they are supposed to withstand light drops of water and easily bare earwax. So honestly try spending a bit more for something more worth while and will last longer
882,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Satisfied,  Fast arrival. Both sets work perfectly.
883,"August 29, 2020",4.0,Great product 👌 since my son likes it.,"  I bought this product for my son. So, I let him answer the questions since he is the one using it. He said he liked it. Thank you for this opportunity. As for me, I was wondering if the price can be reduced somehow 🤔?"
884,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Okay,  They are okay I have had them for a year
885,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods,  Great product and great services
886,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Work great!,"  Love the ease of using these pods. They stay in my ears well, and the charge lasts awhile, around 4 hrs. The charging case it nice. Just plug the case in with the pods and let it charge. Got short term use of the pods, just take them out, use, put them back into case, and they charge some more without having to plug into an outlet."
887,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Pure excellence!,  I got these for my girl and she absolutely loves them! I can’t wait to get myself a pair now
888,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods,  I’ve read reviews that this were not AirPods from Apple and showed people with dirty ear pieces. These are exactly Apple AirPods. They serial numbers were legit and the AirPods were new out of the box. They hold great charge and connected easily to my iPhone.
889,"August 29, 2020",5.0,Good,  excellent product
890,"August 28, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  Better than wired headphones for sure. Easy to take anywhere and simple to use. Worth the money!
891,"August 28, 2020",5.0,Recommend,  This is gen 1 not gen 2 but still good for the price
892,"August 28, 2020",5.0,awesome!!,"  just purchased these, both work amazing! shipping was faster than expected. i’m am very pleased!"
893,"August 28, 2020",5.0,Great !,  Loved it. So useful.
894,"August 28, 2020",5.0,Value,  Awesome product
895,"August 28, 2020",1.0,Poor quality,"  Received item fast. However, left AirPod does not work! Awful!"
896,"August 27, 2020",5.0,Excelentes,  Muy prácticos y cómodos
897,"August 27, 2020",1.0,Wouldn’t order again.,  I did not see anywhere in the description that these were refurbished air pods. I never would’ve ordered them had I realized that. They work fine but the back of the case is scratched up. Bought as a gift for a family member and she has already started using them or I would’ve returned them. Very disappointing.
898,"August 27, 2020",5.0,Love Love!!!,  So functional not having to use a wire to listen to your phone or watch...I didn’t realize how much I would like them until I got them...the battery life is pretty awesome too...I did get the charging case that needs to be plugged in and I’m glad I didn’t spend the extra money - personal preference but I don’t mind at all!
899,"August 27, 2020",2.0,Look for alternatives,"  These airpods glitch out like crazy when they are out of range. Uncomfortable to wear and provides low sound quality. The case is a scratch magnet (make sure to buy a case!!). However, they are stylish. I would’ve returned them honestly."
900,"August 27, 2020",1.0,USED!!!!,  These came used and disgusting!!! Not to mention after close review.... they are absolutely fake! I feel light and cheap and the serial number is scratched off on the original box! This is very upsetting as this was supposed to be a gift. Now I have to return them ugh!!!
901,"August 27, 2020",5.0,Sounds great,  Well packed quality product
902,"August 27, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Love love love them!
903,"August 27, 2020",4.0,Great value,"  Love it . Got one for my self and one for my wife .The sound is u like other very great .But meet the regular use for us .Make the phone call , and watch tv show etc. the only issue is this not too soft . So for me and my family all can’t wear it long time. ."
904,"August 27, 2020",4.0,Good but not for small ears,  This was the first time I spent a lot of money on earphones which was something unnerving for me.Because I’m broke hahahaBut I bought these mainly to workout or when I just wanted to enjoy watching videos or whatever.When I received them they were amazing and I loved these immediately.The only thing that I noticed how that it’s been 4 months is that since I have very small ears they have been prone to slip out very easily.I swear a lot and again I have small ears so if you’re like me then it might be a difficult choice for you as they have fallen off my ear many times already.They sound amazing and last pretty long as I have been able to use these for online school and they last pretty much the whole day except the last period. Which is pretty impressive for something so small.
905,"August 27, 2020",1.0,Not impressed,  I hardly used these because they were at my mom's house when I bought them and I stayed at my dad's during the pandemic so just now is that I cam back and am starting to use them. I have realized that the sound quality is not great. They often disconnect from my phone or the volume does not work like I'm not able to change the volume at times. I think I got a defective pair but now is too late to request a return or exchange which is very disappointing since I did not get a chance to try them until recently because of health reasons.
906,"August 27, 2020",3.0,GREAT... while it lasted,"  This product was amazing for about 2 months and then the left headphone stopped working. I have tried everything online to fix it including cleaning it out, making sure that it's charging, making sure all of my technology is updated to the latest versions, using different chargers, etc. I feel like a new product that was lightly used for 2 months, for this price, should not run into issues this soon."
907,"August 27, 2020",1.0,Fickle right pod...,  I bought these for my wife and they worked fine....for a while. Now we are out of return period and the right air pod will work intermittently and suddenly go from fully charged to empty.
908,"August 27, 2020",1.0,Traaaassssh,  1 of the pods didn’t work!
909,"August 27, 2020",1.0,"Authentic Product, but Wildly Overrated","  If I hadn't authenticated the serial number, I'd seriously think I was sold a counterfeit product.  Since this is an authentic, new product, I'm just left to believe the product is mediocre at best.I regularly use my air pods on both iOS and Android devices. The air pods connect relatively quickly and easily to both, but especially with other Apple devices. (For some reason, the max volume is significantly lower on my Android device.) The Bluetooth range is not great with reception starting to break up if you move more than 4-5' away from the phone.  The sound is pretty clear, but less than 10 weeks after purchase, individual ear buds will cut in and out or get static-y even while sitting stationary next to my phone.  Like other reviewers, my individual ear buds don't seem to charge evenly with one often dying well before the second.  I've also been disappointed with the battery performance. The ear buds re-charge quickly when inserted into the case and I'd say I can probably get 5 hours of run time between charges of the *case*, but I struggle to regularly get more than 2 hours of run time per full charge of the ear buds (and oftentimes not even that).  Finally, I have no idea how people wear these all the time as I found the shape of the air pods to be tremendously uncomfortable.  (Though I am aware accessories exist to mitigate this issue)I truly don't understand the effuse praise heaped upon air pods. I am deeply underwhelmed."
910,"August 27, 2020",5.0,My new favorite walking accessory,"  It’s about time I upgraded fro the off brand! I have gone through 3 different sets of wireless ear buds, and they all failed to deliver. I wish I would’ve just paid more I. The beginning, and skipped all the hassle."
911,"August 27, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  The same as another pair I purchased from Apple. Good quality and customer service.
912,"August 27, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Perfect just what I wished for. Very useful and the sound it’s amazing.
913,"August 27, 2020",2.0,Terrible product,  Terrible sound
914,"August 27, 2020",5.0,I love the sound quality,  They sound amazing and I had ordered a case with it. The packaging even had the packaging on. They were brand new I love them.
915,"August 27, 2020",1.0,Short battery life,"  Battery is only good for 2 to 3 hours. A friend said her first pair had short battery life, she found out they were refurbished.  I don't recall on Amazon website that pair I purchased were refurb. So disappointed."
916,"August 27, 2020",5.0,love the ear pods,  quick and easy delivery
917,"August 27, 2020",2.0,"Okay, but overpriced. Buy from a different brand.","  These are definitely overpriced for the sound quality and battery you get. Plus issues are fairly common with Apple products.ProsDecent sound qualityComfortable in earsCharges very quicklyDecent battery lifeConsOverpriced (it’s Apple so no surprise)Loses battery out of case with no audioBluetooth pairing is hit or miss occasionallyAlso, the right AirPod has trouble charging in the case. The problem with Apple is that when they announce or publish new technology, the older versions are lower in quality on purpose. For example, with AirPods pro released, now the previous version of AirPods are low in quality and break easier. I have to insert it in the slot several times to make the light orange (indicating it’s charging).I’ve treated them fairly well as I should, but this comes down to a technical issue that Apple fails to respond to because they slow/corrupt older software to get people to upgrade.I wouldn’t recommend this version of AirPods since the pro version exists. You’ll probably run into an issue within 6 months. I’d switch to a different brand. Some Youtube videos show which brands to check out and to avoid."
918,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Wife loves them,  My wife really loves them. She uses them when she works out and she has no problems. They connect to the phone seamlessly and work great. Another great Apple product.
919,"August 26, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money.,  Will not stay paired. Music cuts out constantly. Poor quality overall considering price. Very disappointing

921,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Wonderful,  Absolutely love these products tried my daughter-in-law’s in Virginia last week came home and bought my own
922,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Best Wireless Earbuds,  Airpods are much better than the competition. These are authentic; you can check by confirming your serial number with Apple's website.
923,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Great purchase!,  My son loves them!!
924,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Needs work,  Want stay charge
925,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Good purchase,  Durable and excellent audio
926,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Packaging and Delivery Time,  Very please with the timely delivery and as well as the package.Will purchase from vendor again!
927,"August 26, 2020",2.0,Poor,  In start working but after few days not working properly
928,"August 26, 2020",1.0,Product changed prior to shipping to display offensive name,"  Warning: not a trustworthy supplier.  Airpods arrived and when I attempted to pair with device, my device revealed that name of the airpods had been changed to an offensive childish prank name (see picture). What else was changed prior to sending these airpods?  Extremely concerning, disappointing, and unprofessional.  Use another vendor."
929,"August 26, 2020",5.0,What Did I Do Before These Existed,  I love this product. I can walk around while Working from Home and hear perfectly.
930,"August 26, 2020",3.0,They don't last very long,"  The life on these seem to expire rather quickly.  I have two pairs,  but they definitely don't work as well as the first day I got them.  The inside of the case gets dirty real quick and after only a month or two the airpods seem to have trouble connecting and disconnecting from my phone."
931,"August 26, 2020",2.0,Scratch AirPods,  My AirPods came scratch after getting them delivered to me unless you wanna risk getting scratch AirPods I would this is 6/10 while they still work and connect just fine the fact that it came scratch was disappointed
932,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Nice
933,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Good price!,  Sounds great!
934,"August 26, 2020",1.0,Missing items,  Nothing was in the box so how am I going to return  it when there was nothing in it
935,"August 26, 2020",1.0,Dont buy Amazons used products,"  Pay the extra 30 and get them brand new. Amazon sold some used with the tag “Like new”. Definitely not like new scratches, dirt, even found a hair. Disgusting just get them new."
936,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Trustworthy Buyer,  It came in a day early this are real AirPods from apple. Totally worth my money it comes with a charger if u don’t have one or a second one.
937,"August 26, 2020",4.0,Not so new AirPods... working fine though,  Definitely not NEW - which I didn’t expect. As the AirPods when linked showed up with another persons name on it.But they seem to be working fine - just hoping the battery life stays strong.
938,"August 26, 2020",2.0,Choppy and unreliable,"  I bought these expecting a nicely polished product from Apple. I got the opposite. They cut out horribly nonstop, and I have tried troubleshooting them from every angle possible. I am working from home, and spend most of the day on the phone. These have caused more problems that they are worth, and they're likely going to end up in the trash. I would not recommend buying these for remote work purposes. They also amplify strange noises, like quietly opening packages/envelopes. Sounds like that are amplified through the mic, and are deafening to people on the other side.All that being said, for simple music listening, they work. The audio quality is so-so, but they work. It's nice to not have to hassle with cords at the gym."
939,"August 26, 2020",1.0,Got played,  This was a gift. Did not open until today the 26 just to figure out only the charger was sent. Airpods are missing.
940,"August 26, 2020",5.0,Good product,  Love them work great
941,"August 25, 2020",2.0,Why aren’t they both working,  The right AirPod is not working no matter what I do
942,"August 25, 2020",1.0,Defective,"  These aren't real airpods. Mine sound ok in my ear, but everyone says I sound like I'm underwater."
943,"August 25, 2020",5.0,👍🏿,  Yep
944,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Finally have it,  Cheaper than before. Easy wear and convenient bring. Eager for a long time
945,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Me like it,  Me like it
946,"August 25, 2020",1.0,Right AirPod not working help,  My Right AirPod does not work for some reason I’ve done everything to fix it but it still does not connect or work help please
947,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,"  Easy to connect, great sound quality."
948,"August 25, 2020",1.0,One earbud doesn’t work,"  Opened the new product, charged them, and one bud does not work. I’ve disconnected the device, forgot the device, checked my software. No fixes. I need these for digitally teaching this year. Just another headache!"
949,"August 25, 2020",1.0,Stop working after 1year. Don't Waste your money,"  A little after year they stoped working. The Left ear first then they would both work consistently. I called apple and they said product was out of warrantee and they could do nothing but replace them for 69.99 each. They are $159.00 new on their website. What a waste of money. Don't by apple products thru Amazon, they are considered sold as is."
950,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Love this product,  Love this product. Purchased for my 16 year old and she gets tons of compliments. Sound quality is excellent!!
951,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Excelent earphones!,  One year with this earpods and still as new!
952,"August 25, 2020",1.0,AirPods,  Even if a product is used it should be cleaned before its sent... this is disgusting....Device had earwax and dirt all inside the case... really disappointed with this purchase
953,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Love them! Perfect for everything
954,"August 25, 2020",5.0,My Take: Knockoffs Aren’t Apple AirPods’ for Less $$,"  I have only had the AirPods for a few days but for those of you who have wondered if any of the knock offs are comparable to the Apple AirPods, my answer is that at least the one I tried is not. The charging case and earbuds look almost identical to the Apple AirPods,  but that’s where the similarities end. The knock-off’s earbuds  don’t fit the ear the same way and fall out easily,  the connection between the iPhone and the earbuds is spotty, the battery life is not anywhere near what the AirPods offer, and controlling the knockoff is a nightmare. If you’re waffling about spending the money and you really want excellent sound quality and the rest of the differences, spend it. Yes they are priced higher than I wish they were, but the difference is worth it, at least from my perspective."
955,"August 25, 2020",5.0,These work well,"  These work great. No static like other brands I've tried. And people can actually hear me clearly on phone calls!The distance was amazing at first, but after  about a week it started breaking up if I was more than 30 feet from the phone. Good enough. It's held charge well. I have an Android phone and it connects well. It changes between my phone and computer decently also. Oh, they're also comfortable. My other pair would hurt my ear. These don't. I've only used them for calls and the computer. I haven't tried running with them. They stay in my ear and don't move around and don't hurt."
956,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Not even in the same ballpark as the others!,"  Like any other Apple product, these AirPods are amazing. Easy to connect to your iPhone, super intuitive to use, great range (distance from your phone), the sound quality is great, small in size. The fact that you can recharge them directly from the case is another great plus. When you're not using them, just place them back in the case and they recharge on their own! I was so happy with this purchase, that I bought another set for my husband and one for my daughter. Highly recommends!"
957,"August 25, 2020",1.0,bad product,  they didnt pair with phone?
958,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Great Air Pods,"  Excellent Product and Customer Service. Have purchased several and will purchase more for family gifts,"
959,"August 25, 2020",5.0,Ear pods work,  Listen to music
960,"August 25, 2020",1.0,GEN 1 NOT 2,  Description said they were gen 2 but I got gen 1. Not happy.
961,"August 24, 2020",1.0,Doesn’t work,  Right ear does not work
962,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Awesome apple air pods,  Awesome product.  Fast shipping.
963,"August 24, 2020",1.0,Worst Apple Product Ever,"  I am an apple owner, own tons of their products, huge fan. This is the worst product I've ever purchased. 3 months after buying it, one stopped working. After an hour on the phone with Amazon and Apple I finally was able to get them to send me a replacement airpod. Now 3 months later, I'm having the same exact issue. I dread going through the replacement process again, but at this price have no choice. Disappointed."
964,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Awesome quality!,  These air pods are awesome!
965,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  I love these
966,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Perfect.,  Great quality product and keeps charge quite a while. Very happy with the purchase.
967,"August 24, 2020",2.0,Sometimes good,  Right side doesn’t connect a lot of times and have to put it back in pod to hopefully get it to connect. Also music sound will randomly go down on its own.
968,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
969,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Me encanto,  Excelente producto
970,"August 24, 2020",5.0,great accessorie,  works great
971,"August 24, 2020",4.0,Great product!,  I ordered these a few days ago for the first time and I'm obsessed with them. The sound is amazing but I wish they canceled the other noises a little better. Other than that I recommend buying.
972,"August 24, 2020",5.0,It’s loud !,  It’s good
973,"August 24, 2020",2.0,The right earbud routinely will not play,"  When they work, they work sound great.  But this is my second pair within 4 months that will not play through the right earbud.  I have tried all the fixes but to no avail.  I should not have to reset them every time I use them and even then it does not always fix the problem."
974,"August 24, 2020",5.0,❤️❤️❤️,  They are excellent... I absolutely loved them
975,"August 24, 2020",1.0,"Dirty pods, very scratched.","  they sent me dirty airpods with earwax caked inside them 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢 also the airpods were not in a box, they were just in a piece of plastic in the box. i asked for a replacement and they sent me even worse ones that were scratched and extremely worn."
976,"August 24, 2020",1.0,Poor quality item.,  Don’t waste your money on this kind of item. It’s better to buy on an apple store or website. Better to pay more money than a cheaper one that’s in poor quality. Not what I expected.
977,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Best price!,"  We love Apple products, purchased this as a gift, was less expensive than buying on the Apple store so we went here with Amazon. Not sure how they do it, but saved us money! Highly recommended, great product. We love these wireless AirPods."
978,"August 24, 2020",3.0,Meh,"  Convenient is about the best quality. They don’t stay synced very well, I’m constantly having to do a hard reset to get them to connect"
979,"August 24, 2020",5.0,They work great!,"  Love being hands free, and they stay in my ears perfectly!"
980,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Teenage gift recipient SATISFIED!!!,  LOVED receiving her air pods! Happy & studying now!
981,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Love it. Literally can not charge it for days and it’s still good.
982,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Comfortable Listening,  I like being able to listen to music or NPR while I walk.  The pods fit comfortably in my ears.
983,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Air pods are excellent,  Air pods work great
984,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Great product

986,"August 24, 2020",3.0,Good headphones but play time is only 2.5 hours when fully charged,"  Good headphones but play time is only 2.5 hours when fully charged, description says 5 hours."
987,"August 24, 2020",1.0,Broken earphones,  Why did i get charged if i returned the airpods backI need help  right now !!!!
988,"August 24, 2020",1.0,Terrible product,  This product was terrible. I ordered it once and thought maybe I just got a dud because based on the reviews it seemed like a legit product. I then returned and asked for a replacement. The replacement came and was even worse. This is not a good product.
989,"August 24, 2020",2.0,This product is not good,"  After a few weeks, the earphone on the left is gone"
990,"August 24, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  They are real. Came quickly.
991,"August 24, 2020",1.0,Disgusting!!!!,  They will send you gross used products.  Beware!  Apparently you have to buy them from Best Buy or somewhere else.  The buds look mega used.  They have earwax crusted on them.  This is horrible.  Everywhere sells them.  Buy from somewhere else....
992,"August 24, 2020",4.0,ear pods,  love them
993,"August 24, 2020",3.0,Doesn't hold a charge long enough,  Disappointed in the quality. It doesn't automatically connect. Have to force (manual) connect on MacBook Air. Surprised at how quickly they need to be recharged.
994,"August 24, 2020",5.0,excelente,  bueno
995,"August 24, 2020",5.0,very useful,  totally usable and better than the connected headphones! can use one ear while the other is charging. i love it
996,"August 23, 2020",5.0,"More than worth the price, excellent, would buy again","  Love these. Sound quality is superb, battery life lasts a long time and takes like 15 minutes to charge the AirPods to 100% noise cancellation is pretty good I just have to turn it up to a high volume but if you want Really good noise canceling the air pod pros have active noise canceling. If you have an iPhone they connect super easily, all you have to do is open the case and put them in your ears. Well worth the price"
997,"August 23, 2020",1.0,To actually give the AirPods,  When I got them the AirPods wasn’t AirPods
998,"August 23, 2020",5.0,Sounds great,  They keep falling out of my ears
999,"August 23, 2020",2.0,Get a warranty!,"  Writhed great the first few weeks I've had them,  received them on July 9th and it's now August 23rd and they won't charge on the left ear bud so looks like it was a good thing we got the warranty on it."
1000,"August 23, 2020",5.0,Great product,  The AirPod works really good. It's really pratical to wear and fits perfectly on my ears.
1001,"August 23, 2020",5.0,love these,"  I bought these on sale because I really didn't think I'd like them and I like headphones or something harder to lose.  But I found I love these!  I love the sound quality, I love they turn on and off when you take them out, and I love you can tell siri to adjust.  I'm sold."
1002,"August 23, 2020",1.0,hmmmm -are these seconds?,  I bought these because they were cheaper than buying directly from Apple- not sure if they are defective or refurbished ones- the battery life wasn't great but mainly had connectivity issues and voice lag on the microphone- returned and got some from Apple- no issues with these.
1003,"August 23, 2020",5.0,GREAT,  I love these. Worth the money!
1004,"August 23, 2020",5.0,A Gym MUST,"  I’ve been in the market for new Bluetooth headphones for awhile while workingout. The ones I used were large, fell off easy, and would get in the way while lifting weights.I need something that wouldn’t destroy the bank, had a long battery life, and would stay in my ears while laying on a bench or pressing weights above my head.They connected to my phone with no issue after opening, the charger and booklet looked good as new.I highly suggest this to anybody looking for new headphones while at the gym, my only suggestion is to clean them after use if you sweat a lot to ensure they stay in good condition (though it isn’t necessary).You’ll need to charge fairly often though, after a new hour session, I find that the charging box will be about 50-60% battery.Hope this helps someone!"
1005,"August 23, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great
1006,"August 23, 2020",5.0,Exactly what you’d expect,  I notice after 1-2 hours of talking I need to recharge so not sure if this is normal
1007,"August 23, 2020",5.0,Good,  They work really well
1008,"August 23, 2020",4.0,Very good,  Sometimes it falls out of my ears.
1009,"August 23, 2020",1.0,Amazon sold me a used product,"  This was a used/refurbished product. After 2 weeks of using them, people could no longer hear me when on the phone. The audio quality made me sound like I was underwater. I purchased these for work and could no longer use them. I took them to apple and they cleaned them and the problem was still there. Apple notified me that this was a refurbished product that was returned to amazon before I bought them. Amazon should really notify a customer that the product is not new so things like this do not happen."
1010,"August 23, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Works great

1023,"August 22, 2020",5.0,Really convenient only for I phone,  It’s very convenient while having an I phone
1024,"August 22, 2020",3.0,Decent,"  I had them but returned them since they did not fit my ear properly, went for the airpods pros since they fit better with removable tips and noise cancelling but these are good for people looking to get into wireless earbuds."

1026,"August 22, 2020",3.0,After 6 months a AirPod died,  These my first ever apple product. It’s really nice headset however After 6 months of use left AirPod died tried everything online to get it to work no luck.I will stick to other from here on due to durability.. still good quality headset all together.
1027,"August 22, 2020",5.0,Well,  What's more to say; they're brilliant.
1028,"August 22, 2020",5.0,It wasn’t late,  It actually came
1029,"August 22, 2020",1.0,Not a good one,  its been couple of months does not fit into ears properly.  it's not working with what's app too for the microphone.Not worth of money
1030,"August 22, 2020",5.0,These are great,"  I got these to pair with my Apple Watch for my walks and for business calls. I did have to purchase silicon covers so they would stay in my ears. That said, I love these. I’m able to hear well and comfortably."
1031,"August 22, 2020",5.0,The best pods out there at work and charge like they’re supposed to,  Father’s Day present for hubby & he loves them and uses them daily. Charging power is great and last all day plus some time with streaming music and talking on phone all day

1036,"August 22, 2020",5.0,Real and New!!,"  I order these about a month ago and the came in like 2 days!! The AirPods came brand new and IT DOES COME WITH A CHARGER. As soon as I opened it, it connected to my phone. To pause them, you have to take them out of your ear but there is a setting to change that so don't worry! They are great in terms of noise cancellation and even sound quality. When I put them in my ear, they take a while to connect but ultimately they are amazing!!"
1037,"August 22, 2020",5.0,Great for walking,  Love these
1038,"August 22, 2020",1.0,DON’T BUY!,"  The sound quality and everything is legit, but the problem is, after one month or so one earphone tends to get extremely lower than the other. This is my second pair that I ordered, and it’s the same issue. The volume in the right ear drastically decreases. You’re better off buying AirPods from the official Apple website."
1039,"August 22, 2020",5.0,Great value,  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she never leaves the house without  them

1042,"August 21, 2020",1.0,Bad battery life and obnoxious pausing,"  Absolute trash.  Constantly pausing inadvertently,  they don't charge to right out of the box, and also have about a 1hr battery life right out of the box.  I feel like I've been scammed, should have just sold them."
1043,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Amazing quality! Apple is just top notch,"  I just loved it. After having a bad experience with a copy cat, I decided to go with the real deal and the best decision I’ve ever made."
1044,"August 21, 2020",1.0,Planned Obsolescence. Evil Apple,"  I never liked the idea of Apple getting rid of the headphone jack but never knew why.Now I know. It wasn't to make space for more tech in the phone. It was to boost the sales of Bluetooth headphones. And it worked. Apple made a lot of money.I got mine and I really liked them. I also have 100 dollar wired earphones. I've had them both for about 3 years. The airpods no longer have a 4 hour battery. It has a 1 one hour battery per charge. I called apple to ask about getting a replacement. They said it was 70 bucks per airpod. I said, I might as well buy a new pair.That's when it hit me. Apple is making money with the increase in sales for Bluetooth headphones but ALSO insuring that people will come back to buy more when the battery no longer holds a charge. They know this. I don't know about you, but if I pay over 100 dollars for some headphones. I want it to last more than 3 years. My wired earphones work like the day I bought them.This is diabolically evil of APPLE.I AM TELLING YOU THIS AS A WARNING. IF YOU BUY BLUETOOTH HEADOHONES, BE PREPARED TO BUY A NEW SET IN 2-3 YEARS BECAUSE THE BATTERY WILL INEVITABLY DIE."
1045,"August 21, 2020",5.0,LEGIT!!!!,"  Got it brand new from the box, plastic wrapped and everything. They are amazing, they are legit. Love them."
1046,"August 21, 2020",3.0,"Great for listening to music, but...","  When using to listen to audio on computer or phone, they sound great. When using for teaching classes, I have some issues with connectivity and clarity. Could be my internet connection - not sure. Still trying to figure out how to get optimum performance for that. Now after 2 months, the left airpod is not working. Was on the phone for  about 30 minutes with Apple support after spending almost 2 hours going through all the recommended steps on my own to resolve. Now I have to take them to a local computer business to see if they can help me... fingers crossed it will be painless."

1048,"August 21, 2020",2.0,updated,  so far so Goodat first they were connecting fine but every time I have to connect them with my phone and laptop. And for searching the device is so tough. everything in my house connect very easily with Bluetooth except these. Returning all.

1052,"August 21, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Love these!!!
1053,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Best decision ever,  Love them!
1054,"August 21, 2020",1.0,Hope someone is enjoying them,"  I ordered it a day ago, just got the box in the mail the amazon box was sealed but not the package itself, opened it to discover the airpods were not there, so someone at the warehouse must have wanted them rather badly, had to order a replacement, hope that employee is enjoying them and hoping they no long will be working there"
1055,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Loveeeeeee theseeee,  Love these airpods. Love how they are portable and also you get for an amazing deal
1056,"August 21, 2020",3.0,Stopped working after 10 months,"  It’s been almost a year since I bought these and they have officially stopped working. They connect to my device, they pair, they hold a charge, but the sound doesn’t transmit. I’ve tried all the fixes...they’ve worked in the past but not anymore. Seriously disappointing. I was planning on upgrading to the next model, but not if this is what happens. When they worked, they worked pretty well, besides not staying in my left ear. That’s why I wanted to upgrade. I’ve gone back to wired headphones. :-/"
1057,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Pre-named with an insult? Really?,"  Definitely genuine Apple product, and they came in sealed Apple packaging. But I was dismayed that they came already named.I was further upset that they were named:”stupid’s AirPods”.Ok, yeah, perhaps  I am in fact stupid... but still, how did they know that?🤣Anyhow, they work well.Although, this will likely be the last time I buy an Apple product from amazon."
1058,"August 21, 2020",3.0,Not sure how they work.,  I am not sure about this device yet I think that I’m a call to learn how to work these earphones. I thought that they had a turn on and off on the airphone. I also thought that I could just ask or state to call someone and that your earphones Would do so.
1059,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Sorry I waited so long to purchase!,  The sound quality is phenomonel!  Use them all the time!
1060,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Awesome pods,  Wife had been looking for ear buds for several months but nothing seemed to fit right. I bet I bought 3 pairs before ordering these. These fit right away and she enjoys being able to actually use them. She uses these every day now. Should have got these a long time ago. Didn't seem cost effective to buy the pro pods after reading reviews.
1061,"August 21, 2020",4.0,Perfect Truly Wireless Earbuds. Best value for money!,"  These earbuds are just amazing! When I bought it at first, I didn't expect such quality in audio department from Soundcore. It just surprised me - the quality, sound, fit & comfort. Everything. Also it's easy, clear and great for taking calls. Touch controls work perfectly and intuitive/easy to use.These sound better than other earphones I used before. The base, the soundstage is brilliant.It is also brilliant that the audio is magically better after personalizing it. The charging case is awesome with magnets and very simple to use. The buds and case are lightweight. Go for these earbuds. Best value for money."
1062,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Long lasting,"  It’s been over a year and half now, my left ear pod starting to have mic problems, but it might just be that I have to clean it out. I’d like to think that the lifespan for these things is about 2 years at the most anyway. Was a great buy for sure, loved them. I’m still using them."
1063,"August 21, 2020",5.0,Get a pair!!,  Their AirPods ! What can I say!

1068,"August 20, 2020",4.0,Good but not great,  Sometimes the left AirPod will cut out sound for no reason. The battery life is really good though.
1069,"August 20, 2020",5.0,"Good shipping and quality, 5 stars",  Perfect brand new air pods 10/10
1070,"August 20, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods are A Great Purchase!,"  I always saw people walking around with AirPods and I thought they were just a trend. Once I purchased a pair I realized they were a life changer! There is nothing like being able to move around freely with no cords or wires in the way. These AirPods are great, affordable and easy to use. I would recommend them for everyone."
1071,"August 20, 2020",5.0,no cord,  Great value
1072,"August 20, 2020",1.0,One doesn’t work already,  Air pods frequently don’t work together. Too much $ to not work

1074,"August 20, 2020",5.0,a no-brainer if you make calls,"  If you actual talk on your cell, do yourself a HuGe favor and try these (but only the Apple ones).  You will be glad you bought them and feel the same way as me haha."

(Also today is my day off), I had AirPods from my brother before but they were fake and lasted a month before literally falling apart, but THESE.......are real and I’m soooooooo freaking happy I finally saved enough to get my own!"
1079,"August 20, 2020",1.0,i would love to review these Apple ear pods but i received an empty box,"  I ordered in early July, never opened because they were a gift for grandson.You can imagine my disappointment and embarrassment  when they weremissing from the Apple box.I realize i have no recourse but feel very ripped off.Mary"

1083,"August 20, 2020",5.0,Quality,  No substitute for quality... sound is great volume adjustment is good.  You can still set the volume to hear the air pods and your surroundings or turn them up and block surroundings .  Battery life is two to three hours for the pods the case stays charged for the whole day
1084,"August 20, 2020",2.0,Don’t always charge,"  Well, they don’t connect all the time and some go in the case and don’t charge. Spend a little more money and get from Apple directly"
1085,"August 20, 2020",2.0,FIT,"  They kept falling out of my ears, no matter what I did or changed. I am switching back to Raycon."
1086,"August 20, 2020",5.0,"Love them, beautiful strong clear sound",  Love my airpods

It feels very upmarket and feels awesome when you wear it.Gifted it to my sister and she is really happy about it :)
1091,"August 20, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money.,  I bought two of these airpods and they are not worth the money.  Neither one is usable and they are not a year old.  I lasted about 3 months and they just gave me some of my money stating that the warranty had run out.  My god this is a apple product and the other one lasted about five months. idid not even bother with this one because they probalay wasn't going to give me anything back.
1092,"August 20, 2020",5.0,I live,  I love
1093,"August 20, 2020",5.0,Once you go Apple Air-bud you can’t go back!!,"  With all honesty, and fairness. Kid u not before I purchased these Apple earbuds. I purchased more than 8, different types of earbuds, spend a lots coin’s. All had different effective problems. But when I decided to go with Apple air-buds. I wish I could get all my money back from all the others. There is a saying, once you go black you can’t go back. Mine is once you go Apple Air Buds, you can’t go back to anything else!! And that is the fact!"

1103,"August 19, 2020",1.0,Don’t order from here.,"  I’ve had these less than 10 months and they are already malfunctioning on the daily. No water damage, never use them for anything other than phone calls when I’m driving."
1104,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Extra Excited,  I am so hype that i have I phone ear buds now I don’t have to worry about getting tangled up in cords and pulling the old time head phones are a thing of the past
1105,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Great quality!,  I like the quality of the product.
1106,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Great Sound,  Amazing !!! great sound and fast delivery !! 100% worth you money !. ( yes I already put them in)
1107,"August 19, 2020",1.0,DEFECTIVE,"  my left air bud doesn't work, not sound at all. straight out the box"
1108,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Earbuds,  Love!
1109,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Worth It,"  These things are the bomb.comMy husband uses them for Discord when we play games with our friend group. The mic is great quality, the sound coming out is great quality, and they look sharp. Definitely will get our moneys worth out of them. Even accidentally washed them and they've survived, and dropped them on our tile floor multiple times without cracking."
1110,"August 19, 2020",3.0,"Great for music and calls, not so much for online meetings.","  I love the convenience of and ease of airpods. I am almost always using them for listening to music or watching videos on my macbook. Mic can be a hit or miss depending on where I am and how I am using it. For phone calls in quite settings, it's good. For outdoors, not so much. What disappoint me completely is that that it is a fail when taking online calls or video conferencing. My sound is always muffled for others and there is a lag between the video and the sound. I have yet to find a bluetooth earphone that works best for online calls. Apple needs to improve their game when it comes to mic. Maybe better than many, but not the best. With over a $100 price point I expected more.  Overall, neat product if you will use it for occasional phone calls and music."
1111,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Best choice I’ve made. I love them
1112,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Excellent quality,  Best purchase I have made in a long time! Great product.

1117,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Fantastic surround sound quality.,  Tried fake ones first.  These are without a doubt the best!
1118,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Good buy,"  Good quality, came on time!"
1119,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Easy and Freeing,  I love the quality and how easy it is to use and change to another device if needed.I am a Sign Language Interpreter and some of my work has been from home and it's nice to not be limited in my signing space because of traditional wired headphones. Very freeing.
1120,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Thanks Amazon,  AAA+++
1121,"August 19, 2020",5.0,Amazing product at the best price.,"  I keep misplacing my AirPods so I thought I would give these guys a try. WOW! Im so happy I did. they sound great and with the volume on high ""drowns out my work  sander"" they still lasted 4 1/2 hrs with one charge. they are bigger than my AirPods so they are EZ to find and put in my ears. Calls come in clear and people cant tell that they are on them like some Bluetooth earphones. Best thing is that if i loose one I can replace it for 1/5th of what I was paying. They ae a great deal!"
1122,"August 19, 2020",1.0,My earbuds don’t work and they never have how do I return them,  Earbuds do not work they never have I want my money back

1126,"August 19, 2020",5.0,They were good,  Good
1127,"August 19, 2020",3.0,Falls off ear.,  Comes off your ear easily. One fell in the sink down the drain the next day after buying it. The pro is much better.
1128,"August 19, 2020",1.0,Guaranteed product not working,"  If I could give 0 stars I would. Amazon said they guarantee this when I saw it on amazon warehouse. I guess they did not test it for more than 5 minutes, because after that no one can hear me talking. The only thing it’s good for is to play music. As soon as someone calls you, you have yo switch back to your phone 😩. So upset I wasted my money."
1129,"August 19, 2020",4.0,good,  It's easy to use except that it's more expensive.

1141,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Ear Buds,  Great sound don’t count on these buds to cancel noise
1142,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Best but pricey,"  Fit my ears so they don’t fall out. I knew these would be better because they were Apple but so much more expensive. Almost worth the price 😊 Good bass, comfortable all day,"
1143,"August 18, 2020",1.0,Left side stop playing sounds. For the price you may look for other alternatives.,  Left side stop playing sounds. I checked many youtube videos on how to solve this issue.They were mainly about 2 strategies.1. Reset the airpod and reconnect it to your iphone.2. Clean them.I just used it 3 days and left side stop working.Double tap commands work but no sound at all is like if left side is muted.Got in contact with apple customer service. They recommend the same i searched before and available in youtube.I am a MAC user and normally I recommend people to use them but stay away from airpods.I don't feel is right to pay the price of them to later try to fix this kind of issues.
1144,"August 18, 2020",3.0,Buy unused products. Even if it saves you a couple of dollars,  Got a little cheaper because they said packaging blemish. There was no blemish but pods had been used I guess because they had already recognized someone else’s name. False advertising
1145,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Good price,  Great price
1146,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Sound clarity,  Great quality
1147,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Love these,  Husband surprised me with a pair and they are all I use now. Clear sound and battery last longer then I thought. Would definitely recommend getting a pair
1148,"August 18, 2020",5.0,it's good. It even survived after I dropped one of them in water,"  These AirPods work fine! I like them.I dropped one of them in water while I was washing dishes. I dried it for a few days and then charged it, and it worked! If you ever drop it in water, do NOT put in the charger. Completely dry it for a few days and charge it. Then it should work fine again!"

1154,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Love it,  I love these! The only thing I don’t like is that sometimes some songs are lower than others and sometimes I can hear people even with the volume at its highest. All In all these AirPods are awesome!

1156,"August 18, 2020",2.0,Right earpiece died in a few months,"  Only the left earpiece works, the right earpiece is now dead. Welp, it sorta works. Not worth the money."

1158,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Works great
1159,"August 18, 2020",5.0,I love the AirPods,"  I embarrased myself one day when I tried to put my wired ear pods into my phone and almost hung myself.  Right there and then I said, ""I'm purchasing wireless technology!""  After researching I decided on the Air Pods and I love them.  Should have bought them sooner but nonetheless I have them and I use them faithfully.  I did not know that the battery life is not that great but I overcome that with using one at a time and keeping the case charged."
1160,"August 18, 2020",5.0,I like this most.,  Very user friendly product no complaints.
1161,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Nice sound,  I am very happy with these. These are not the noise canceling model but am very happy with them.

I love this I just wish I had the nerve to get them sooner.Thank you Honey,"
1164,"August 18, 2020",2.0,Frustrated,  After 7 weeks the left ear bud stopped working
1165,"August 18, 2020",5.0,Cost-effective,"  The charging performance of this charging compartment is very good. It also supports Bluetooth. It also has a pop-up window. My headset can be used normally. It is almost the same as the original one. It is very easy to use. The price is very good. There are also small gifts. Nothing wrong! 1:1 box, just fit with the original protective suit, no gaps, fast charging, sufficient power, these two points are very satisfactory, praise is a must."
1166,"August 17, 2020",4.0,Apple wins again,  I purchased these airpods for my son and he loves them. I would’ve given 5Stars but they kept falling out of my ear.

1174,"August 17, 2020",4.0,Not sure if new,  Bought for my husband for our Anniversary. When he loaded them they said “Noah’s AirPods”. Embarrassing for a gift. Are these used?
1175,"August 17, 2020",5.0,Fantastic performance,  I had been resisting getting them for a while and then given the situation we are all in it became a necessity as Zoom and conference calls became the vein of our existnence. They are great on every call.
1176,"August 17, 2020",1.0,Preprogrammed with Bad language!!!,  Very unhappy these were for my 12 year old daughter and came named extremely inappropriate!!!

1185,"August 17, 2020",1.0,EMPTY BOX!,  Really bad experience! The untampered Amazon outer box came with an empty apple AirPods box. LITERALLY empty straight from the dealer. BEWARE!!
1186,"August 17, 2020",5.0,Fits my ear,"  I’ve tried other knock-offs , they were all too cumbersome for my small ears.  Apple AitPods fit perfectly, forget I’ve got them in sometimes ...and they don’t fall out Easily."
1187,"August 17, 2020",1.0,One earpiece no longer works - only have had ear buds for 4 months,"  That didn't last long. The headphone have not been exposed to water or sweat or any severe elements, yet one ear piece stopped a mere 4 months after I purchased it. I would have returned it for a replacement but apparently the window is closed. It's a shame that I've spend so much money on an unreliable set of headphones. I hope others don't have the same experience that I did."

1191,"August 17, 2020",5.0,Great anniversary gift for husband!,"  My husband loved these, he works in a laboratory and this is helpful because the cables were in the way as he was doing experiments. He just forgets and walks too far away from his iPod and then the music stops. He solves this by keeping it in his pocket. He loves the sound quality and the lack of cables!

1197,"August 16, 2020",5.0,THEY ARE REAL!,"  I bought these off amazon because they were $16 cheaper than the Apple store. I was skeptical about it being genuine but I checked the serial number on the Apple website to see if it was REAL Apple AirPods and I can honestly say that THEY ARE 100% completely real. They connected to my mom’s iPhone really quick and she loves them. They came clean, unopened package, and the audio quality was the same as MY own AirPod which I bought from the Apple store. I had to compare it just to make sure she’s getting the real deal cuz it’s my mom and I am glad I took the chance to buy these from Amazon."

She loves not having a cord in the way and how simple it was to connect and set up these headphones. Our kids would get mad when she was listening to podcasts while being around them, but now she can do that without them knowing. Haha! She loves how much easier it is to use these while exercising because they are so compact and cordless.Only complaint is the lack of controls on the headphones themselves. Can’t really control volume or pause/play by touching the headphones."

1206,"August 16, 2020",1.0,They don’t last long,  You might want to buy these somewhere you can easily return them like Costco. I received mine April 30th and by August the right air pod is done. I reset my settings and everything. Ridiculous price for how long these last.
1207,"August 16, 2020",2.0,Did not last more than 6 months.  Constantly fall out of my ears.,"  Mixed feelings on this item.  I have a pair that I have had for about a year and a half that still work well.  I only use them a few times a week, but other than the fact that they constantly fall out of my ears, I like them.  If I wasn't able to find the aftermarket silicone ear hooks that I need to use to keep them from falling out all the time, I would have returned them and give them a 1 star rating.  To be fair, I have small ears.  So, I would consider another option if you have small ears.  That said, this review is for a second pair I bought as a gift.  Unfortunately, after 6 months the right pod would not charge/work at all.  The left one would work, but only for about 20 min.  If fully charged and left in the charging case, both the case and the working pod would completely drain, which implies the batteries are not good in the case or the pod(s).  The person I bought these for didn't tell me about the problems until several months after she noticed it.  So, I had her give them to me and contacted Apple.  Support was really good and they tried to help me get them to work over the phone.  Unfortunately, no luck.  So, I asked what my options were to get them replaced or fixed.  They said they were out of warrantee and it would cost over $200 +$12 S&H to get them repaired.  I paid under $150 for them, so naturally all I could say was thanks for the help...  I guess I'll just throw these in the trash.  There are a lot of options out there that are a lot less pricy.  So, I will replace the gift, since I don't like to give a gift that is defective.  However, I may look at the Samsung or a couple of others that are out there.  Again, the ones I own still work fine.  This pair was obviously just a ""lemon"", but since Apple wasn't willing to do anything, I have a bad taste in my mouth.  Pretty disappointed with Apple.  Such good service, but won't stand behind their products.  Don't even get me started about the easy-break glass on their phones and pads."
1208,"August 16, 2020",5.0,I love these! 10/10,  I can’t say enough about these! If they are a good fit in your ear 10/10
1209,"August 16, 2020",5.0,Pricey but Amazing!,  My very first airpods.  Have always wanted one of these. Went with the first generation because I couldn't justify buying the airpods pro nor the second generation. I don't have a wireless charger so I wouldn't have been able to use that feature anyways. They came nicely packaged and connected to my iPad pro instantly. The sound so far sounds great. Still figuring out its features but so far I am impressed. I bought I case to protect my expensive new earbuds. For anyone who is curious the case is by i-Blason Cosmo series here on Amazon.

1215,"August 16, 2020",2.0,Not great,"  These were replacement ones for my originals because my original set had issues with one pod connecting. These are far worse and I regret having my others replaced. 50% of the time they don’t connect when I put them in. They’ll show on my phone that they’re connected but there is not sound.  But when they actually work, they are good other than the battery life is worse than my original. I feel like I got a refurbished or used replacement because of the lack of quality."

It will sit in a fully charged case for a day and come out with only 4% life remaining. Return window closed after a month so I spent  $130 for a product that doesn’t even last two months. Buyer beware."

Either you have a thief working for you or you think you can rob me!  The box was torn on one end.  I was okay with that but then I opened it and it was empty cardboard inside with a charging cord underneath.  I didn't even order a charging cord.  I could not be madder!!!!!!!

1248,"August 14, 2020",1.0,Don't buy!,  They worked great for the first few months but then started having to charge a little more often and now I get people saying they can't hear me. I bought these for work as I speak with a lot of provider offices but since they seem to be going in and out I can no longer use - definitely a waste - I will stick to buying from Apple directly as they stand behind there products regardless of time

1259,"August 13, 2020",2.0,Make sure you keep track of the serial number,"  I was using my AirPods on a work call at the grocery store and the AirPod case accidentally fell out of my pocket. I was unable to find it and when I contacted Apple to replace the case, they informed me that I needed the serial number, which is written on the case, to replace the case. The serial number wasn't on the invoice from Amazon and so unfortunately, I'll have to purchase an entire new set of headphones. Frustrating experience. Lesson: either make sure you don't lose the case or make sure you have the serial number saved someplace."
1260,"August 13, 2020",5.0,My life is complete now!,"  Greatest earphones ever!I don’t know how I ever lived without these, seriously, not just the earphones but the great little case that they come in that charges your ear buds even when it’s not plugged in so perfect to have when you’re traveling.The ear buds not only allow you you to  call people by simply saying “hey Siri” but it answers any questions, it reads and composed text messages if I ask, it plays music etc. etc.  Simply ask and you shall receive.I can now cook with my hands full while dancing to the beat of any song I ask Siri to play, ask Siri to take notes for me or even help give me recipe ideas.Once you’ve used these you will also ask yourself how you ever lived without it as it makes your life so much easier.The sound is fantastic  along with the noise reduction and whomever I’m speaking with hears me well.These are pricey but I assure you they are worth every penny you pay."
1261,"August 13, 2020",3.0,They're OK. I wish I bought them elsewhere though.,"  I was hesitant to purchase Airpods because of the steep price so when I saw there was a deal a few months ago (early 2020) I hopped on the bandwagon! Since I have many Apple products, these DO make it easier to sync up to my Macbook, iPhone and iPad. However, even with that being the case the airpods I received were defective. I spent hours talking to customer service and at the Apple Store (pre-COVID) and they ended up having to replace the case and one of the airpods. At times I still have issues with connectivity and the microphone isn't the greatest. Sometimes my airpods would be in the case and I wasn't trying to connect to my phone yet the music would play WHILE THEY WERE IN THE CASE. I even reported this to the apple care team and my customer service representative told me it was something they'd never seen or heard about before. (Seriously wish I was making this up, I just wanted to be able to have wireless earbuds).I'll admit that I don't fully regret my purchase, but regret buying it via Amazon instead of from the Apple Store or a major retailer (i.e. Best Buy). Not sure if my logic makes sense, but I feel like there would've have been less of a chance of getting a faulty item.TLR; Airpods aren't a bad investment, but be wary and monitor your item if you buy it via Amazon. ALSO they aren't noise cancelling and the microphone isn't the greatest. The sound is OK but if you want to still spend a good amount of money, you probably can get better quality headphones elsewhere. The best feature to me is that it is super connected with my apple products and I can tap to change the songs, etc."
1262,"August 13, 2020",1.0,E,"  This product is shoddy. There is so much break in sounds it is ridiculous. I am better offUsing the regular wired headset. I tried everything including charging the Apple  AirPods overnight thinking that may be the problem. Of course to no avail. I got tired of  the pods that I left them  on the shelf. Of course when I called Amazon, they called Apple and referred me to Apple Customer Service instead. Sorry I bought this poor quality product. I may have been better off with Chinese “ knock off” version, if such is on the market"
1263,"August 13, 2020",4.0,Not impressed,  My daughter was pressed to get these so we got them for her for her birthday.  The sound is basic and the battery life sucks.  Overpriced for sure....you’re paying for the Apple logo...lol

Took them out of their case and I was asked if I wanted to pair them with my phone, said yes and they paired and named in one button push.  Was disappointed to find that there is no volume controls on the buds, need to adjust the volume on my phone.  Sometimes it’s difficult to transfer a call to the buds. It’s not as easy as just choosing the buds from the drop down list.  I had to Cycle my phone off/on and call somebody back to Get to work.  Over all satisfied with product"

1311,"August 11, 2020",3.0,They do not function as advertised,  I bought these I thought as an alternative to more expensive Apple AirPods and was I wrong. I used them solely with my IPad and the sound bounces periodically from one ear to the other losing sound in the other ear. This is an occasional occurrence but annoying enough to be unhappy. When I first tried using them with my Android phone they wouldn’t stay connected and I had to carry my case with me. I don’t recommend buying these. I purchased a warranty with them and my first contact with CS was not fruitful. I will update my review shortly.

1314,"August 11, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Love them!
1315,"August 11, 2020",5.0,Good purchase,  AirPods have been working very well. No complaints so far.
1316,"August 11, 2020",1.0,Very low quality product,  Sound quality worstNo charging
1317,"August 11, 2020",5.0,Comfortable!,  Easy and comfortable to wear.
1318,"August 11, 2020",5.0,Amazing product!,  Wonderful buy! So happy 😁
1319,"August 11, 2020",5.0,Great quality!,  This was a birthday gift for my daughter and she loves them.  She always has them in or with her.  Plus she used them on a weekend trip we took to drown out my snoring at night.
1320,"August 11, 2020",1.0,overpriced piece of apple,"  It is hugely overpriced for what it is. The sound is tinny like from $10 phones. The battery life is degrading fast with time.  The only difference from cheap bluetooth phones is the tap action, and even that does not work properly most of the time."
1321,"August 11, 2020",1.0,USED,  THEYRE ARE USED!!! the charger wasn’t packages and there was earwax in the case and in the headphones. had to go to best buy to pick up another (new) pair.
1322,"August 11, 2020",4.0,"As advertised, fits well for running!","  I bought these specifically to pair with an Apple Watch Series 5, and to support my running goals. They fit very well especially when rotated towards the mouth. The sound quality is good enough to support listening to guided runs and playlists. Once they’re fitted, I didn’t even feel them. They’re awesome!"
1323,"August 11, 2020",2.0,"Replaced 3 times, STILL HUGE issues.","  AirPods have great sound quality. Unfortunately, they are not worth the trouble. One of my AirPods stopped emitting sound and they replaced it via warranty; this happened 2 more times, for a total of 3 replacements. Now my AirPods won't connect to my MacBook, and when I asked Apple support, they walked me through the steps I had already done several times from their public support pages. Go elsewhere for your wireless headphone needs."
1324,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Great product! Highly recommend!,  These work out so well with the stuff I do around the house and when I’m working at my job! 100 % helps out a lot
1325,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Best Earbuds I’ve ever Owned - beats Bose,"  I am a musician and as such have used a variety of headphones and earbuds. For recording you want a flat response but for pleasure, you want a slightly sweetened sound. I have two pair of Bose earbuds that I really like but I was shocked at how good these AirPods sounded. I heard instruments I’d not heard before. Better stereo separation and great deep but articulated bass.And they run for hours, handle voice commands perfectly and are great in my office for phone work. And they literally recharge to 100% in 15 minutesThese are the best sonic and overall earbuds I’ve ever owned."
1326,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Great Airpods,  It was a gift for my wife. She likes the AirPods🔥🔥🔥
1327,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Use of merchandise,  I like it
1328,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Very comfortable when used,  I did not know how practical and comfortable is to use it in the bed while watching prime videos.
1329,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Great,  Love these life changing
1330,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Air pods,  Good price. My son loves them. So far everything works perfectly.

1337,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Very pleased,  Very pleased over all
1338,"August 10, 2020",2.0,Not Exactly What I Expected...,"  Just received and I found my order Apple AirPods in disarray within the shipping box that was also about 4x larger then needed, see attached photos. They were also already setup as Paula’s AirPods #2. They seem to work now but thought they were new or at least refurbished by the Apple Store on Amazon.Clearly used Apple AirPods (!?) and not packed for postal shipping well at all. 🤔"
1339,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Apple Airpods,  I really enjoy these airpods. I love the wirelessness of them. I didn't like the wires from the earbuds. These have pretty good sound quality. Price is good. Very easy to set up. I would order again.
1340,"August 10, 2020",5.0,AirPods,"  My son loves these son loves these AirPods. No complaints from him. I don’t think they’re designed to block our noise. If you are looking for noise cancelling, this is probably not the product for you."
1341,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Great,  They are awesome love everything about them
1342,"August 10, 2020",5.0,The best,  Very good buy
1343,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Excelent!!,  Excellent
1344,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  It’s great and I love it
1345,"August 10, 2020",1.0,DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE,"  Don’t waste you money. First off these were a week late, I’ve had these for over a month now and honestly I just want my money back. I’d use them and after 10 minutes the AirPods will go out and disconnect and won’t reconnect again. (Fully charged) and it keeps happening over and over again, I tried resetting it and it still does the same thing. I was honestly excited for these but honestly I’m highly disappointed"
1346,"August 10, 2020",5.0,💯,  No complaints
1347,"August 10, 2020",1.0,Air Pods not working after some time,"  Issue is these are defect pods, which it worked for a while now, i am not able to hear both. One is working one time and the other is working for other time."
1348,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Great Earbuds,  Love the AirPods.  Great sound from a small earbud.  Fits comfortably in your ear.  Would recommend to anyone.
1349,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Love it !!!!,  My niece loves them.
1350,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Worked perfectly for me,"  I wanted to get these because the wired headphones kept getting in the way while I was doing work (I'm at a research lab so I do a lot of work with my hands) or while running (the cord yanked the headphones out a lot). These are very solid and reliable and worked perfectly for me. The battery on the headphones themselves last hours, and the battery on the case lasts days. They sync up perfectly for apple products (do NOT work on windows surfaces). They do bleed out noise pretty bad, but their sound quality is also pretty good in my opinion. Would definitely recommend."
1351,"August 10, 2020",5.0,Thanks,  Thanks
1352,"August 10, 2020",5.0,good,"  Very good, good sound quality, very comfortable to wear, big brand trustworthy"
1353,"August 9, 2020",1.0,AIRPODS STOPPED WORKING,  AirPods stopped working after a week
1354,"August 9, 2020",1.0,Do Not Waste Your Money On This!!!!!,"  I bought this for a birthday present, I was so embarrassed that these were not good. They lasted Half a Day Of use! I highly recommend do not buy this I don’t know if these were good or not but as a gift to somebody do not buy them let alone for yourself! Now they said as a paperweight!"
1355,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  All I can say is WE LOVE THEM!!!!
1356,"August 9, 2020",5.0,The real deal!,"  I researched extensively before I bought and received the AirPods 2 with the wired charging case and these AirPods were exactly what I expected. These were the genuine article, no fake AirPods, no ear wax anywhere to be found, no dirt or any indication that they were used. When I paired them initially it just displayed the name AirPods. I don’t understand what is the big confusion as to what is 2nd generation and what is 1st generation (it has a choice of a wired or wireless case). No noise cancellation on these and I didn’t expect it to be; I like it that I can hear my surroundings when I jog. “Hey Siri” is great and efficient. Great product."
1357,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Comfortable with good sound quality,  Do you see your phones are very comfortable and have excellent sound quality.
1358,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Awesome
1359,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Love them!,"  I love these!  They fit so much better than the AirPods Pro, and are much more affordable.  Sound quality is nice, and they last about 5 hours on a charge.  I use one Pod until it’s dead, then switch to the other one while the first is charging.  Easy to pair, and easy to use.  Only thing I have an issue with is the double tap on the left Pod isn’t very reactive.  But I use Siri for most commands, so I don’t have a big problem with it."
1360,"August 9, 2020",1.0,Stopped functioning after 1 month,"  Hi,They worked fine for the first week and stopped functioning completely."
1361,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Worth It,"  I absolutely love these, best purchase I’ve made in a long time. The regular apple wire headphones were my go to before, but running with a phone and wires is no fun. I use headphones way more now that I have these - whether I’m cooking, exercising, or video chatting they are so convenient and the batteries do last a while."
1362,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Expensive,  Grand daughter loved them
1363,"August 9, 2020",4.0,Relly good,  It is a really good item to have if you want it
1364,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
1365,"August 9, 2020",1.0,Air bud problems,  I bought these July 10 and just now able to try them. The right ear bud does not work. Today is the last day to return or replace so I have tried numerous times to call today only to sit on hold forever.
1366,"August 9, 2020",5.0,They're awesome!,"  Was a gift for my stepson, and he cant say enough about the quality and ease of use."
1367,"August 9, 2020",5.0,n/a,  good
1368,"August 9, 2020",1.0,"Came used, gross.","   These came clearly used. Somebody else’s name already assigned to them, ear wax in both headphones (yuck), and a case that rattles.Pretty lame to sell used stuff as new."
1369,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Should buy,  Perfect it came in the official box connecting it was a breeze as soon as I opened the case it popped up on my phone
1370,"August 9, 2020",1.0,If you want to waste your money...buy it,  For the amount of money this cost 6 months later it does hold a charge.  I won't be purchasing again
1371,"August 9, 2020",4.0,Stereo,  Needs softer peace’s for ear insertion other wise terrific
1372,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Apple air pods,  I haven’t had a problem with them
1373,"August 9, 2020",4.0,"Amazing sound quality, seal not so good.","  Great separation, sound quality and noise cancellation is a plus. Only drawback is they constantly lose their seal in my ears."
1374,"August 9, 2020",1.0,Waste of money,"  I have only used these maybe 6 times and the left ear does not work, I have been wanting these for so long I'm so disappointed, my $30 cheap ones worked better then these."
1375,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Nice product!,  Perfect earbuds for granddaughter and her work!
1376,"August 9, 2020",5.0,These things are pretty great,"  I love being able to throw these things in my pocket. I felt they looked a little goofy at first, but I got over that. They don't advertise these ones as noise cancelling, but I swear they do cancel out some of the outside noise, and I don't think that's just in my head, either. They aren't cheap, but I have a pair of these and a pair of Beats Studio Earphones, and that way I can go either way, which usually means I use the AirPods for walks, or going out, and the Earphones are for the beach, or at home (is it just me or is it just a little scary being basically deaf to the world around you at times?)I think they ought to include these with the purchase of the expensive phones that Apple sells, but that's just me.One last thing-supposedly the newer generation are more sweat resistant than these ones, but I haven't had any issues there, so I'm not sure what that's all about. It's not like I'm a marathon runner, but I have worn these in the summer on long walks, and besides cleaning them with a q-tip here and there, there's no issues.The battery life is about 2 hours, maybe a hair less than that, but if you just bring the case with you, you put them back in there and about 15-20 minutes later they're charged again. The case itself needs to be charged every so often, which roughly translates to every 2-3 days, or every 3 charges. They last a long time if they're just sitting in the drawer, not on the charger, which makes them available to use pretty much at all times. As the corny cliche goes, I don't leave home without them."
1377,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Connects Quickly,  Super easy to setup and use
1378,"August 9, 2020",5.0,Worth every penny by far,  Great sound and very easy to use and sync up
1379,"August 9, 2020",5.0,My Experience,  I love my ear pods been using them all day lol so glad I got em now. These are perfect I highly recommend
1380,"August 8, 2020",3.0,Left ear dose not work,"  Great airpods however, The left one doesn’t work that’s a shame I might get new ones for Christmas."
1381,"August 8, 2020",5.0,I would definitely recommend getting these.,  I bought AirPods almost two months ago and they work great! I literally use them everyday because they’re so convenient. The earphones and the case charge really fast and the battery life is great.
1382,"August 8, 2020",5.0,Amazing Match for iPhones,  Amazing. If you have an iPhone then these are the perfect match. I thought other Bluetooth headphones were a good fit for this but not like these. They are perfect. Amazing sound so worth the price paid for them. I recommend it to those that own Apple products.
1383,"August 8, 2020",5.0,Perfect condition,"  Something happened on my 1st order but got them the 2nd time. I absolutely love them, I had purchased the AirPods Pro but I didn’t like them. I 100% recommend them."

1385,"August 8, 2020",5.0,Amazing AirPods,"  Amazing, totally recommend buying this."

1389,"August 8, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,  Bought these as a Christmas gift and they have held up perfect! Would definitely purchase again!
1390,"August 8, 2020",1.0,faulty airpods.,"  On July 31, 2020 I was buying these 2 generation airpods at a price of $ 129 dollars + shipping for a total of $ 138.03 dollars. I sacrificed saving money to buy this product, but after I received it and tried it, I began to realize that the sound is not of high quality and it sounds very bad. previously I had 2 airpods and I know how they listen. It is a unique and excellent sound but the ones that came to me are useless. After claiming the Amazon customer service they tell me to return them to be able to make a refund, I explain that it is very difficult for me to return them because I live in the Dominican Republic the shipping cost is very high, even so the customer service agent tells me that I should return it. I feel bad because I did not imagine that Amazon handled this way with its customers. now without money and without airpods, because it is not worth using them like that with that bad sound."
1391,"August 8, 2020",5.0,Llave equivocada,  No puedo recojer mi paquete del bidón ya que dejaron la llave equivocada...me podrían ayudar gracias...

1400,"August 8, 2020",5.0,I love them,  They’re amazing
1401,"August 8, 2020",5.0,AirPods Review,"  I was getting so sick and tired of having to constantly keep buying Apple earbuds every couldn’t of months bc they wore out fast. My last pair didn’t, my dog just chewed them up and I ordered the AirPods to stop from wasting so much money over time and I’m in love! It’s the best purchase I’ve made so far. They work very well and the battery life shocks me. It charges up fast as well. I charge my case once every three days because I dont wear both AirPods at the same time. I’ve never been used to wearing both earbuds so once one dies I charge it and take out the other and keep exchanging them."
1402,"August 7, 2020",3.0,Bought new and received used,  The AirPods I received are great but there was one problem with my order. I bought new air pods but received used air pods. When I went to connect them they had some “Alexandria's roommates AirPods” as the name... as far as I know that sounds like  these must have been a pair of used EarPods.. I feel like I need the price difference back..
1403,"August 7, 2020",5.0,excelente producto,  Excelente producto lo recomiendo
1404,"August 7, 2020",1.0,Not happy,  They’re not loud at all & they die pretty fast. Not happy
1405,"August 7, 2020",5.0,Great!,"  I first ordered some cheaper version of bluetooth ear buds because I didn't spend that much money. HOWEVER, once the cheap ones died fairly quickly and I decided to invest in the real Apple AirPods and I LOVE them! It's very worth it. Easy to use, can take everywhere, battery last very long and sound quality is good too. Good choice!"
1406,"August 7, 2020",5.0,Super,  Super
1407,"August 7, 2020",5.0,Amazing product,  Fast shipping! Would order again if something were  to happen to these I would definitely order once again! Worth the money!

1409,"August 7, 2020",5.0,2nd Pair of Airpods,"  I lost my last set of Airpods after three years...the battery life was getting bad, so I was happy to buy another pari while waiting for the new Airpod Pro's to be back in stock.I really love these headphones. They stay in my ears (even while running a 1/2 marathon) and have great sound quality.They charge fast and last for several hours while listening to books podcasts etc.They are worth the $$!Just don't lose them or it will break your heart. Luckily I got them quick with PRIME!"
1410,"August 7, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  So far so good. Haven’t tried them yet. For my daughters birthday. Brand new packaging
1411,"August 7, 2020",1.0,Why are these so popular?,"  1.) Continually falls out of your ear.2.) Cannot eat food with them in your ear (because they fall out).3.) Be careful over sink or toilet because they might fall out.4.) Quality is not that great when on the phone (sounds like it cuts from MONO to STEREO, constantly)5.) Barely get a days worth of use when using for work connect to a computer.6.) Limited functionality, am I missing something?7.) Did I mention they fall out?"
1412,"August 7, 2020",3.0,"Nothing wrong with the seller, be careful with using this product for too long.","  Nothing wrong with the seller. The airpods have a great design. They look cool, space white.Cons: don't use them for too long. They give headaches and your ears hurt. I don't recommend using them more than 30min-1hr per day."

1420,"August 7, 2020",5.0,Extremely sleek and good quality,"  I love my Airpods 2. It automatically connects when you put them on and the sound quality is absolutely amazing. The battery life is crazy long especially with the wirelessly charging case. The double tap feature is extremely easy to work with and if you need anything else you have Siri to help you out. Apple enthusiasts look no further, just grab your pair now because you should have already!"
1421,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Buy the real deal the first time...,  Had bought the knock offs and they broke within a couple months. It is nice to have the real deal. Only two mechanisms you can set up (off/on/pause or skip song). Would be nice to have a couple more options. Apple should have that ability...
1422,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Totally Buy these,  I LOVE THEM😍😍😍😍

1427,"August 6, 2020",5.0,139,  Good product but not very good for Android
1428,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Amazing AirPods,  These AirPods are amazing and they’re loud and clear. These are worth the purchase. Thank you ! I love them. These are a must buy honestly speaking. I got mine new and clean out the box. My AirPods arrived clean and new.
1429,"August 6, 2020",1.0,Failure within two months of use.,"  After giving these as a gift, with less than two months of usage, the left earbud is not working. Responds to touch commands, but no sound, and now we are about a month over the return window. All tech suggestions to correct it have failed. Now we get to deal with Apple for warranty, so we'll see how that goes. These are merely a fad, and not a quality product. I suggest to resist those birthday wishes and find an alternative brand."
1430,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Work great,  Gift for my husband. He really likes using them for working from home.  Can use for his music and to take calls.

1440,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Love them!,"  Absolutely love these!  Like others, I wish I hadn’t waited so long to buy them. They’ve improved my quality of life. I can now watch shows late at night without being worried about the neighbors complaining (I’m also a bit hard of hearing.) They have allowed me the flexibility to crank up the music while I’m cooking or cleaning. I can get lots more done and still enjoy the music. They help me understand the instructions in my yoga class as the sound is more consistent when I’m (or the instructor) are in different positions. They stay in place and recharge quickly. Even when I’m recharging my device, I can use the AirPod to listen to a program, ebook, music or whatever before falling sleeping and the next morning everything is good to go. Easy to set up with my other devices and that’s really saying something from me 😁."
1441,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Very good investment for walking and running while talking or listening to music,  I love these air pods. They are so comfortable you can wear them all day!
1442,"August 6, 2020",4.0,The airpods,  I’ve had them since January but mine doesn’t work as good anymore ....
1443,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  Love them. And for a great price as well.
1444,"August 6, 2020",5.0,love the sounds !

1445,"August 6, 2020",1.0,Overhyped product,  Overhyped product. I should have better bought in store after trying them. It is so irritating that they don't stay in ear and fall down. Sound quality is okay. Nothing great. I am hardly using them right now. I feel it was waste of money.  I would suggest to check out brands before finalizing this one.
1446,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Perfect
1447,"August 6, 2020",4.0,They’re ok,  They’re ok
1448,"August 6, 2020",5.0,brand new high quality,  These airpods work perfectly and came brand new. When they first came i did have to charge them a bit more but that’s expected of almost every wireless earbud. I love the quality of the sound and the microphone. The fit and comfort is beyond any other earbud i’ve worn before. I recommend buying this 100%
1449,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Very nice AirPods,  I bought this as a gift to a very special friend. She was very happy with it. No problems so far and it's been months.  I'm happy with my purchase.
1450,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Great product,  I got these yesterday and they were worth the money great packaging brand new and great sound quality I can kind of hear noise cancellation and the battery life is great I opened them and they connected right away and said my name I love this product even this my first day using them fully after charging them overnight they are a great product now I am looking into buying the wireless charging case separate and see if that is as wonderful as these. Overall great product 5 out of 5 stars and 9 out of 10 for me oh and the hey Siri feature works with the gen 2 without the wireless charging case.
1451,"August 6, 2020",1.0,Not good,  I bought this like 2months ago and stop working. my calls get interrupted definetively waste of money
1452,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Better than those cheap models you see on the net,"  I first purchased a look alike from the net at $34.99.  Should have purchased Apple the first time. Now, I'm happy. They hold a good charge and last hours. Those cheap model didn't hold a charge for more than one hour to two hours. Apple has a great product."
1453,"August 6, 2020",5.0,Must have,  The sound quality
1454,"August 6, 2020",5.0,I recommend buying them,"  They are great, so easy to use just take them out of the case and put them in your ear and they turn on automatically. I love them. Absolutely worth the money"

1458,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Amazing earbuds!,  Best Earbuds period! I have been through a million different pairs and these out do any by far. Thank you Amazon and Apple!
1459,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Great,"  Product is excellent, exactly what is shown. Real Apple product! Love them"
1460,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Great Wireless Headphones,  Great for video conferencing especially when you have others near by due to stay at home order. It cancels out the noise and keeps your meeting private!
1461,"August 5, 2020",1.0,THERES STILL EAR WAX IN THE HEADPHONE,  there was still ear wax in the headphones. GROSS. 10/10 would not recommend. buy new this is disgusting.
1462,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Compartiré con otros sobre mi compra,  Me agradó muy bien
1463,"August 5, 2020",5.0,"Excellent sound, and frees user up from being tied to their phone!","  My first pair lasted just about a month and the left one failed...no more sound in L AirPod.I called AMAZON and I had a new replacement within 2 days! This second pair works great so far.My son has had these for several years and has never had a problem with sound or charging. He steered me towards this product and I am glad!So much easier to be using the AirPods for phone calls and not having to hold my phone anymore or use the speaker. I hear well with these and I can walk away from my phone to attend to something I need to do. Others hear me well when I am conversing with them on the phone while using the AirPods.Very good product, excellent Amazon support for first 30 days or so on this item and then continued support is available through Amazon."
1464,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Love it.
1465,"August 5, 2020",5.0,"Works with Android, too!","  Bought these to pair with my Samsung Galaxy S9 and they work beautifully! People can hear me, clearly and they have really good sound quality, on my end, too! Totally satisfied."
1466,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Best pair yet ! Holds the charge quite a long time.,  I use them while I’m mowing.
1467,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPod,  Fits snugly in my ears and feels good.Good sound Quality.
1468,"August 5, 2020",2.0,Won't stay put in my ears,"  The sound is OK, but all the time the earphones are wobbling in my ears, I'm told they don't fall down, but it's a very awkward feeling, and sound quality diminishes when the earbuds get loose. Also, every time I press them back on, they pinch my ears. A small silicone piece would have solved both these problems.Amazon agreed to the return of the product.I tried to give the phones one more chance before sending them back and the right earphone started to fell when I nodded my head sideways.So it's of no use for me and I'm not going to pay for the Pros because of this basic problem."
1469,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Love this product,"  Work great, sound great, and feel good."
1470,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Excellent product. 100%,  The best in the market. A must have

1473,"August 5, 2020",5.0,Very good sound quality,"  Fantastic AirPod. I used to use different cheaper brand AirPods. Now I realized that I was compromising on sound quality, comfortability. Original Apple AirPod is really a great one with best sound quality, battery life, small and comfortable."

1483,"August 4, 2020",5.0,Best Headphones Ever,  Fast shipping and great quality.
1484,"August 4, 2020",5.0,Water proof tested!,"  I received these Apple Ear pods this past Sunday and charged them overnight to start using them Monday around the house. I was in my backyard servicing my Koi pond when the left ear pod feel out of my ear as I watched in horror straight to the bottom. it didn't float for a second, straight down. I reached down retrieving it and immediately dried it off. I thought @*%$# just wasted $134 in my Koi pond!!! I blew out any external moisture there was and gave it a rice bath for about 24hrs. This morning gave it a charge in its case, then paired it with my iPhone SE and Sirius XM sounds perfect! No residual damage from its visit with my Koi. Amazing!"
1485,"August 4, 2020",5.0,Airpods are convenient but slightly overrataed,"  Airpods are mainstream because of the apple logo, but they also sound quite nice. Overall build quality seems pretty solid despite its light earpieces, and the sound quality is nice"
1486,"August 4, 2020",5.0,The BEST deal,  I had looked a few places for the best prices on these airpod and I gotta say I'm really happy I found these!
1487,"August 4, 2020",2.0,Does NOT Last,"  At first I really liked them. They stay in my ears and didn't hurt that much, and the battery life seemed to last for a long time. I've had them for about 6 months now though and they have stopped working the way they are supposed to. When I want to use them I have to fiddle with them a lot to get them to work and most of the time only one ear bud is charged. They don't pop up on my phone when I'm trying to see how charged they are and when they are charging only one of them is charging at a time. I don't know what to do because it seems like a total waste of money to buy Airpods for $130 for them to only last 6 months. Now I'm looking into buying new wireless earbuds but I'm definitely not going to be buy Airpods again. :("

1492,"August 4, 2020",3.0,They’re not so good,  They’re a little staticky and sometimes the bluetooth disconnects i’m not sure if that’s normal.
1493,"August 4, 2020",5.0,LOve my new Airpods,  Bought a new apple watch at the same time and the airpods connect to the watch and I get music on my walks from my watch.  It doesn't get any better than that.  Also added cell service to the watch so I can take a call through my airpods from the watch.  As soon as I hang up the music starts playing again.  It is so nice not to be tied to your phone all the time so the watch and airpods are a great combo.

1502,"August 4, 2020",2.0,Don’t understand the hype.,  They literally fall out all the time. I don’t understand the hype. Just like the $15 ones I bought from Marshall’s. The sound and battery life are good but they keep falling out while doing basic activities or just sitting in bed.
1503,"August 4, 2020",5.0,Product is exactly as described,  Exactly what I was looking for and delivered in a timely fashion

They do not connect to my phone or anybody else’s phone (all Iphones btw) who tried to help me which is rare for an Apple product.

I was walking outdoors and speaking on the phone with my son and he said he could even hear the birds singing in the background, but I had no trouble hearing him.  Wonderful, the charge lasts a long time with the charging case.  Will probably get a pair for my husband."
1515,"August 3, 2020",5.0,Eccelente,  Excelente

1522,"August 3, 2020",5.0,Beltone,  I love that the ear pod are small. A person has to be pay attention to notice them. What I don’t like is  they can be dislodge from your ears with little afford.

1528,"August 3, 2020",1.0,Please beware the Amazon / Apple cheats you out of warrenty,"  Apple is considering the warrenty from the date you ordered and  by the time Amazon  process it and ships the order its few days (you will be losing a week of so on your warrenty ) .  Exactly around 1yr time frame our Airpods started giving trouble with low volume  after giving run around by both Apple and Amazon, we provided all the proof of receipt etc . They  told us that they cannot honor the warrenty to get it repaired as they consider the Order date as Warrenty, I wish I would have gove to a  physical store to buy  . Even if Amazon shipped it to you  late you will be cheated out of few days so they can get out of providing help . Think twice about ordering"
1529,"August 3, 2020",5.0,Easy to connect an easy to use simple.,  LOVE THEM USE THEM EVERY DAY SOORY ABOUT THE CAPS LOCK I JUST LOVE THEM THAT MUCH.😂😍
1530,"August 3, 2020",5.0,love mine other than how they get so dirty,  i love mine and i think they are worth the money. its awesome not having a cord to worry about. also having a new iphone with out a headphone jack these allow you to charge your phone and listen using earbuds at the same time. the only problem is the case collects dirt and lent in the inside and i do not know how to remove it.
1531,"August 3, 2020",1.0,No sirven solo se escucha uno,  No se los recomiendo a nadie me duraron solo un mes y un día a penas se venció la garantía se dejó de escuchar uno
1532,"August 3, 2020",5.0,Worth the money you pay,"  When doing daily chores or running on the bike path, the earbuds remain snug. It may depend on each individual on whether it becomes uncomfortable after a long time within the ears."
1533,"August 3, 2020",3.0,Not sure about all the hype,"  I paid way more than I ever would have for these under normal circumstances but it was a ""splurge"" buy and I really wanted ear buds/head phones that were not only good but comfortable. Unfortunately, this was not my best purchase. They ""pods"" are hard plastic and make the inside of my ears sore. Maybe I am just use to my BEATS and am a creature of habit."

1538,"August 2, 2020",5.0,Apple Earpods: Still Great After All These Years,"  Simply a nice upgrade to what I had purchased before.  What a difference an apple product makes.  OK, so here's the choice:  Charging case with a cable or via wifi? Needless money spent there! I just plug the little case in, no issues there and just 1-2 times per week.  These are the first generation and for my ears, they are fine, they fit.  I am very happy with NOT spending more and getting such a quality earphone.  They have worked fine for zoom meetings, walking conversations, and for watching movies at home from my ipad.  They easily pop up on your bluetooth screen for whatever device you are using.  Just choose ""studio earpods"" on your screen and they will begin."
1539,"August 2, 2020",5.0,Easy to use,  Love apple headphones quality is perfect in mint condition and worked amazing. Bluetooth was super easy to connect

1550,"August 2, 2020",5.0,Cut the cord get airpods!,  They are so worth it! If your worried about losing them if you have air cloud and find my iphone enabled you can actually locate your case and play a sound through your headset if you have lost them - I have to use this all the time because I set them every where.  I would buy these 100X over.

I bought another pair. I am a lady and the earpieces are just too big for my ear canals. they are highly uncomfortable. They pop out of my ears when walking and listening to music. If I had extra money, I would have bought the pros, as they have soft tips to put over. I bought a plastic line that is magnetized so I won't lose them. They pair up easily with my iPhone 11."
1557,"August 2, 2020",5.0,If you like freedom...,  Can’t believe  I haven’t purchased a pair of these sooner. Now I can charge my phone while I move around and talk on the phone or listen to whatever. I love the freedom it gives me.

1569,"August 1, 2020",1.0,Someone else’s AirPods,  Got these as a birthday gift for my father. They came up as “Liz’s AirPods”. So I have to assume these were an open box that was re sealed and sold as new. Pretty slimy. Especially cause you put em in your ears. I’d hate to buy underwear from the seller.
1570,"August 1, 2020",5.0,Great to certain level..... Read why!,"  Let me began, I hate apple products with passion, BUT I was tired of people complaining about (my voice) not being able to hear me due to background noise on my Rowkin earbuds picks up(amazing for music specially under motorcycle helmet).Bought the Airpods for my android Oneplus 6T 🤘 and it took a minute or less to sync, impressed with Apple for not making these just for their own devices.Hasn't used them enough to talk about comfort level or battery.They are in OEM box/packaging, and the serial no checks out for warranty.Pros,Sound quality is good in my ears and I still care hear my surroundings (good for work and walking in Street where you need to be alert).Price is within range of other good quality earbuds.Case is cool and the feature they sit standby and connect immediately once airbuds are out of caseCons,Doesn't feel secure in my ears, although haven't fall out yet.Apple proprietary charger, catch up Apple, USB C!!!Android doesn't show battery level, does for other Bluetooth devices but not Airpods, there are apps work great.The volume is low for music, but great for phone/video calls(primary reason I bought these for).Do I recommend it? Absolutely if you talk on the phone alot.If this review was useful to you, please follow me for more reviews. Thanks!"

1581,"July 31, 2020",3.0,Just so so,"  I also have earbuds for my android phone and they are far superior. The ones for IPad don't function with tapping on the pod to mute, move forward, or backward, at least that I've found. They also don't fit as well in my ear canals."

1589,"July 31, 2020",5.0,Made mom happy,  My mom is not a fan of earphones so I new that now that she needed me to get one for her I needed to buy the best I could find (even though her phone is an Android instead of iPhone). She's been very happy since receiving them. At least I got quite some extra point on her scorecard after such gift
1590,"July 31, 2020",3.0,fall out of ears easily,  I like them but they do not fit everyone's ears well. Twice I have had a pod fall out and then it doesnt work anymore.

1595,"July 31, 2020",1.0,Defective merchandise,  The left AirPod won’t hold a charge so they won’t pair with my iPhone  It came a week late!!  Now I have to return it.  Guess I should have ordered direct from Apple
1596,"July 31, 2020",5.0,InstantConnectivity,"  Music is my game, and I love to listen to my favorite music on a high noise level. No worries about bothering the neighbors, now. I purchased these from Amazon at a one time discount, a little nervous that I would not receive the quality. No worries, noise cancellation, perfect, quality of sound, excellent, ease of use , very easy.These arrived in a tight pa kati g as all of App'e products do. Once I got in and read the directions, it was very easy. The pods were at different levels of battery life,so I plugged them in. Both at 100% within a short period of time. The bBluetooth was turned on, instantly the ear pics were connected. I put them in my ears, and started listening to the new Rufus Wainwright’s CD, ‘Unfollw The Rules’. Beautiful music and Rufus’s voice came through. I am quite happy with these ear pods.Recommended. prisrob 07-31-2020"

1600,"July 31, 2020",5.0,easy to use,  I love these!! They are easy to use and no cord to deal with.
1601,"July 31, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods,"  Very happy with these.I bought several others (cheaper) before the airpods and none suited. Too big, wouldn’t stay in ear, not great sound, etc.While I paid more, it was worth it.Pairs very easily, great sound, can use iPhone charger to charge, fits my ear. Doesn’t fall out.Absolutely no complaints."
1602,"July 31, 2020",5.0,Good deal,"  Battery life is fantastic, product has a nice weight to it, feels very solid. The earbuds have tons of volume, decent amount of bass but nothing crazy, I personally think they are lacking in the vocals though. Tried a variety of songs and the vocals just sound the tiniest bit dampened behind the rest of the music, just not as crisp and clear as it should be. Over all great earbuds for the price, well worth it to not cheap out on."
1603,"July 31, 2020",5.0,Worth the price!!,  My mom really wanted a pair after she saw how convenient they were for her coworker at work. I finally was able to save up and get my mom a pair for her birthday and she loves them. She doesn’t leave the house without them!! I’m currently a college student with one as well and I really think it’s a great investment. Worth the price!! The battery life on it is also really good and I sometimes go days without charging.
1604,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Great price and quality,  Sound amazing
1605,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Get em’,  These are great.  Got a great price and fast shipping. Use them almost every day.
1606,"July 30, 2020",5.0,No issues,  This is my first pair of AirPods and overall I like them. Battery life is good. They haven’t fell out my ear or anything. My main use for these are when I’m out on the lake.
1607,"July 30, 2020",1.0,One pod didn’t work,  AirPods came in and only one AirPod was working. Troubleshooting and nothing could get the other one to work. Had to return and replace
1608,"July 30, 2020",1.0,"Don't waste your money like I did, buy some Beat Pro's.","  AirPods are over hyped, one of my worst buy that I ever made and here is my reason why.1st- didn't not charge correctly-one side will charge to 100% and the other side would be at 2%. I tried everything in the book/youtube to make this work and nothing. It charge at 100% when it wanted to. This would hurt my workout times and had me super upset2nd- sounds quality was horrible, wasn't loud at all and I could hear what was going on in the background. It just sucked3rd- would fallout of my ears easily, any small bump and they're it went.4th-waste of moneyThe only good thing that came out of this is that I'm now a proud owner of Beats Pro's. They worth every cent and I haven't had to go through any of the issues that I had with the AirPods."
1609,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Left ear bud stopped working,  Left ear bud stopped working!!!!
1610,"July 30, 2020",1.0,SCAMMM!!!,  Don’t buy this!!!! I purchased this item and it only came with the box and no AirPods NOTHING AT ALLL JUST THE BOX !!! Save your money
1611,"July 30, 2020",4.0,Like these earbuds better than anything else but wish battery lasted longer,"  I love these earbuds, but I really wish the battery lasted longer. I'm on my second set."
1612,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
1613,"July 30, 2020",3.0,Short life span,"  These started out great. Paired good and worked right out of the box easy.Granted I work on a construction site so they take a little more abuse.After only a few months it seems like the battery life has shortened.I can get maybe a solid 3.5 hours out of them.Then there is the right AirPod issue.Constantly it won’t take a charge unless you reset.Constantly I pop them in the case and go to use them later and the right one would not charge unless reset.Now currently if paused for a while it disconnects and I have to go in to settings and reconnect. Big let down for only having these roughly 7 months, paying 150$ for mediocre long term quality. That’s Apple for you"
1614,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Better than the pros,  These original model air pods fit better in your ears

1618,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Just love them !,"   Just love them, I’m hearing some of my favorite songs in a whole new way with these AirPodsAbsolutely love my headphones, but I’m not surprised Apple products are the best you get what you pay for!***ALSO for all these negative reviews it’s because they’re are two options under this listing for NEW wired charging AirPod and, USED wireless charging AirPod. not realizing the AirPods that come with the wireless charging case are USED** just pay attention before ordering y’all !"
1619,"July 30, 2020",5.0,New AirPods,  My AirPods was suppose to be here tomorrow but they came a day early which I loved. They sound amazing & as you can see they’re brand spanking new charger cord was in the box they fit my ice cream case I bought with them & they were at 75%  when they arrived.

1622,"July 30, 2020",4.0,Love these,"  This is my third pair of airpods.  Love them so much, keep ending up giving them to other family members and having to buy new ones for myself.  Have tried many different ones from other companies and they all don't compare to these.  Love them and definitely recommend."

1631,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Best purchase I’ve made in a long time,  The only problem is the case gets dirty really fast
1632,"July 30, 2020",5.0,Great quality!,  Love my new earphones (earbuds).  Product was delivered quickly after placing my order and the sound is wonderful.  Great quality product.
1633,"July 29, 2020",1.0,Be careful!!!,  These were not apple brand!!!!!

1639,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Great,  Love these.
1640,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Worth it !,  ** Case sold separately ** I absolutely love my AirPods! They are so convenient for work and these are 100% REAL from Apple. I checked the warranty on Apple’s website and got confirmation of authenticity. Would definitely recommend ordering a cover for your AirPod case so it won’t get scratched up or lost. Overall very satisfied with my purchase
1641,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Best,  I like that they were the real airpods and came in perfect condition love them very much!!
1642,"July 29, 2020",4.0,Great find,  These are my 1st big purchase from Amazon and I love them for the price I got. I’m not sure if it’s iPods in general but sometimes the sound gets weird. But I’d buy them again
1643,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Good deal.,"  Definitely a second generation of Airpods. I was choosing from the AirPods pro and normal AirPods, this one won. I was concerned having something in the ears is uncomfortable. A case is needed if you care about it being scratched. I noticed scratches in just one or two days."
1644,"July 29, 2020",5.0,AMAZING!!,  love love love!!! One of the best purchases Ive made in a long time!
1645,"July 29, 2020",5.0,BUY THESE,  Works perfectly ! Love them !!

1651,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Great Buy,  Awesome headphones great sound and holds a charge overall great buy
1652,"July 29, 2020",1.0,Used?,"  I was given a defective product, possibly used? Am returning for a replacement hoping that this was an oversight."

1654,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Great gift!,"  I can't say anything about them, as I gave them as a gift. The recipient was thrilled and she said, they were exactly what she wanted!"
1655,"July 29, 2020",4.0,Ex,  Excellent
1656,"July 29, 2020",3.0,Meh.,"  They are pretty good, but like many Apple products, they just aren't worth the premium price.  There are plenty of other great bluetooth headsets out there for half the price."
1657,"July 29, 2020",5.0,I am very pleased with my airpods.,  I would recommend to my friends.
1658,"July 29, 2020",1.0,One side stopped working,"  Doesn't matter how well they worked because they only worked for a little over a month, then one just stopped working. Don't buy here. Buy from apple."
1659,"July 29, 2020",1.0,Seller mixed and matched versions,  After 30 days the headphones worked for music but callers could not hear me.  The AirPods are the 2019 version while the case is a 2017 version.  Yes the case works for charging and the AirPods work for music but they are generally not worth the money since they do not fully work.
1660,"July 29, 2020",1.0,Airpods,  This product cost too much for it not to give good quality!
1661,"July 29, 2020",5.0,Very happy - wallet is happy with too,  Seems to be fine so far! Got a pair of refurbished iPods and they looked brand new! Just the box was damaged. Saved myself $30 buying these. I’m happy with them so far and have had no problems at all! I also bought a cheap case for them and it fits  perfectly.
1662,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Wonderful,  I love these and didn’t break my bank! Pair up and battery lasts a long time!
1663,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Good,  Very good quality
1664,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Great for the prices,  They sound great for the prices. I definitely recommend them. They’re perfect for working out and working. The sound quality is great. The only dislike I have is the sound cancelling. Other then that this is an amazing product.
1665,"July 28, 2020",4.0,Good product,  Very good product much better than any of the competitors but just keep in mind these are not the $250 pro units so no noise cancellation and the battery life is OK always keep the charging compartment with you because I average maybe 2 to 3 hours max before completely discharged to zero
1666,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Extremely easy to pair,"  I bought these for my fiancé and she loved them. She’s been wearing them nonstop for the past couple of days. She loves the portability, how easy it was to connect to her phone, and the fact that they read her any text messages she receives."
1667,"July 28, 2020",5.0,The Real Thing!,"  These are definitely the real thing! Do not be hesitant to buy, you can nearly always trust orders that display “sold by Amazon” and “shipped by Amazon.” Love them! Sound quality is great, and yes there were some connection issues that occurred, but only when I was pairing them with other Bluetooth supporting devices, like my laptop. Though these were solved and they work just fine!"
1668,"July 28, 2020",4.0,Look in to more reviews it’s important.,  I don’t like that I have to put in both headphones for one to connect.
1669,"July 28, 2020",1.0,Sorry product,  These iPods are a big disappointment the left pod won’t hold a charge over two hours you will be listening to something and it just goes out. I have been an Amazon customer for quite some time and this is the worse purchase I ever made.
1670,"July 28, 2020",1.0,Disappointed,  Very disappointedWay below my expectationsWill returnI know it’s open box but this doesn’t mean to be defectiveThe microphone is not working and the battery drains quickly
1671,"July 28, 2020",1.0,GREAT IF YOU WANT OTHER PEOPLES EAR WAX,  Don’t buy I bought the AirPods and the charging case was fine no Knicks it was all groovy until the left ear pod had ear wax inside .... like really you have to be kidding me won’t be buying from them ever again
1672,"July 28, 2020",4.0,Good product,"  Great sound, very sharp."
1673,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Review in Airpods,  As if I bought it from the Apple Store!
1674,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Love Them,  I was very hesitant to get these because I thought they looked weird on people and they would fall out of my ears. I went ahead and got them when I started quarantining with friends in a house and we were all working. I needed them for meetings and I love them.  I love that I can walk around if needed while on a meeting and talking too.  They were totally worth it like most apple produces.
1675,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
1676,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Very good,  I am happy with the AirPods.
1677,"July 28, 2020",2.0,Only works great with apple devices. Very bad quality with windows or google devices,"  Only works great with apple products. When you try to use with google Samsung galaxy note, the sound is very low and you can’t increase it. With Windows computers the sound also average. So you couldn’t use this headset for business meetings if you have windows P.C.I think they make it on purpose so it only works great with apple products.When I use cheap headset with Samsung and windows devices, the sound 10 times better."
1678,"July 28, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"  Love these! Can never go back to regular headphones. Totally worth the price, amazing quality. Charges super quickly and holds a charge for a long time which I love."

1680,"July 28, 2020",2.0,Doesn’t work,  Very disappointed. Only had it a few months and the right pod stop working. No one can hear me on it. Nothing was damaged never dropped it never spilled water on it. So I’m not sure why it stop working. Not happy
1681,"July 28, 2020",5.0,sounds great,  this is my second pair because the first pair got damaged when i was cleaning them with alcoholdon't do that again!!
1682,"July 28, 2020",1.0,Right Earbud Keeps Disconnecting,  I've had these for about two years and have had to re-connect them to my phone about once a week. The right earbud keeps disconnecting. I've tried all the online fixes - none work!

1688,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Love,  I love it
1689,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Love the quality.,  I like the battery life and how when I get a text message the airpods tell me what my text message is saying while I'm driving.
1690,"July 27, 2020",5.0,"Great purchase, but ummmm.......","  I got these in the mail yesterday and could not wait to use them. They’re great. I love them so far; however, when I went to connect them to Bluetooth for the first time the name listed for the AirPods popped up as “Sugar Tits AirPods” lmao. Ummmm i’m not sure exactly how this happened? Honestly I think It’s pretty funny and don’t really care but my only concern is I hope I didn’t pay full price and get used pods that someone else already named “Sugar Tits” lol. Maybe the guys at Apple were having some fun? So yea that’s my review on this lol! Weird as hell."
1691,"July 27, 2020",4.0,I see the appeal...,"  The battery doesn’t last long and doesn’t give you much warning before it dies.  I don’t know where to see the battery life other then to ask Siri.  Also can’t be connected to multiple devices at once, not to my knowledge at least.  I had a set (with wire) for $10 from Walmart that did and it was really nice during working hours. However these are super convenient, no wires to get tangled.  When you remove an ear bud it automatically pauses for you... This is its redeeming feature"
1692,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Nothing was wrong works great,  I love my air pods
1693,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Its airpods,  It's a nice present for my wife
1694,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Very comfortable,"  Ill tell you off the bat I own both the air pods (2nd gen) and air pods pro, and these air pods (2nd gen) are by far way way more comfortable to use while laying in bed. I only use these while I lay in bed so I can't really tell you how they are when I'm working out but the comfort on these definitely out beat the pros any day of the week. But not the sound quality since its not sealed."

1698,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Original !!!! Awesome,"  They are original! I compared them to the ones that my coworker had bought from apple and they are legit. They were NOT dirty ( I was afraid of that being an issue since I read other reviews complaining about it ) but not my case! They came super quick and  nice and properly sealed. Charger, case and AirPods brand new out of the box. I’m very happy with this purchase. Have been using it 24/7 and the battery life is awesome!!! Can’t be happier"

Very easy to both use and takes seconds to set up. Battery life is solid, lasts very long, and charges within minutes via the battery case. They fit well in the ears and do not fall out too easily. Overall, amazing for every day use."
1702,"July 27, 2020",5.0,First time was empty,  The products fine how ever the thief’s at Amazon aren’t . This is the second pair I’ve had to order the box showed up empty the first time so just be advised when ordering there’s a risk . They did refund my money but it was a hassle

1705,"July 27, 2020",1.0,Delivered defective,  The right ear piece never worked right out of box. Real dissapointment as it was a gift.

1709,"July 27, 2020",5.0,im the Classic Man,  Are used them everyday!  Their better than the phone itself!
1710,"July 27, 2020",1.0,Stopped working after 1 month - Could not request a refund or support,"  For the first month I had these air pods, I really enjoyed them. A month in (and for no reason) one of the air pods stopped working. I tried to request a refund / support on Amazon and was directed to Apple, however Apple did not have record of my purchase and I was unable to get any support or a refund. These were very expensive so I am very dissatisfied with the outcome."
1711,"July 27, 2020",5.0,PERFECT,  LIKE
1712,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Love them,  There great work awesome
1713,"July 27, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Comes in Apple packaging
1714,"July 27, 2020",4.0,Worked great for awhile,"  Love these AirPods, but now only one side works"
1715,"July 27, 2020",3.0,Left AirPod doesn’t stay charged,  Left AirPod never stays charged

1718,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Good quality!,  Love them. I even bought two sets!
1719,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Love them,"  Let me first say that I have been on the fence on the price point since launch. I own a pair of beats powerbeats 3 and have enjoyed them the last few years. I got a pair of anker true wireless and fell in love with the true wireless feel but did not like the hard press buttons on the side. I ended up caving and getting these and all I have to say is WOW. They are amazing and I will be grabbing a pair of the next version pros on release. Until then I will enjoy these. The sound quality is pretty solid, noise cancelation is slightly better than regular pods but you get the idea. I bought them for riding on my rocket and listening to some music and it’s the perfect combo for listening to my rev range and music. Overall I’m happy with my purchase. Much love 🏍👊🤍"
1720,"July 26, 2020",5.0,They Must Be Great,  ...because they are always stuck in my son's ears and he won't let me use them.
1721,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Long battery life,  I don't use these often but have had them for a few weeks now and haven't had to recharge them yet!Not the most comfortable but maybe I just shove them too far into my ears.
1722,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Apple always,  Real pure white color I love it and sound surroundings perfect apple
1723,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Great!!
1724,"July 26, 2020",1.0,Broke immediately,  Got these hooked up and immediately the right one got really hot. Then it stopped working. Had to try to reconnect by having my phone forget this device and then it never hooked up again.  Pretty sure the right one fried itself
1725,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Impressed,"  Still not as loud or impactful as my Beats, but I really like the AirPods!"
1726,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Exactly what I expected,"  Perfect, this is exactly what I expected!"
1727,"July 26, 2020",5.0,"Great earbuds, purchased twice","  Just love these earbuds. I had a pair that I unfortunately misplaced a few months ago. I decided I didn’t want to pay for a new pair so I bought a much cheaper pair. But you get what you pay for. They were so awkward, kept falling out, and didn’t sound good. These are excellent. Fit perfectly and comfortably. Also sounds fantastic and pairs with everything so easily."
1728,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Totally worth it!,  Worth every penny :D
1729,"July 26, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money,  The batteries do not last very long.  About an hour and a half and the left headphone keeps on cutting in and out.  They are only about 2 months old at the most.  This is surprising.  I wish I could return them or at least exchange them.  This was a big waste of money.  I have better battery with my older 40 dollar ones
1730,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods,"  I LOVE THESE. I don't know what I did before I bought them. I use them everyday. Around the house, working out, running, working, talking on the phone. I haven't had any issues with them. They charge really quickly and have great sound."
1731,"July 26, 2020",5.0,WorthIt!,  Good buy works perfectly
1732,"July 26, 2020",5.0,They work great,"  I haven’t checked the serial # on Apple to make sure they’re not fake. So far they’re legit, everything came in the box, they had a 70% charge and seems to be working just fine."
1733,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Good deal. Works well.,  Great product for a great price. Cheaper than The Apple Store. Same price at Costco.
1734,"July 26, 2020",4.0,Not a good first impression but overall good,"  So far they sound great. Much better than knock offs. I chose the used, like new condition. They came dirty but alcohol easily cleaned them. The lightning cord was not in the box or package. Amazon support made it right and refunded me the amount it is for a new cord. Overall, satisfied!"
1735,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Well worth it!,"  Love these! I was having trouble with my phone falling and pulling my earbuds out, I don’t have that trouble with these. I can leave the room and the headphones still work great!"
1736,"July 26, 2020",5.0,They are fine,  Fine
1737,"July 26, 2020",5.0,great  christmas present,  great price
1738,"July 26, 2020",4.0,Not too shabby if you have $130.00 to spend,"  I was vehemently against buying AirPods... but I received a gift card and I decided to give these macaroni noodles a chance lol. They’re not too shabby... exceeded my expectations, BUT there are cheaper better sounding headphones that you can purchase for 3x’s less the price and will last longer."
1739,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Good,"  Easy to use, excellent sound"
1740,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Work exactly as advertised and intended.,"  I tried another earbud manufacturer and product which would not hold the pairing to my iPhone. I returned that unit and got these Apple earbuds which were delivered the very next day and the sound quality, pairing capability and consistency, are far superior than the other earbud manufactured product."
1741,"July 26, 2020",2.0,Don’t by them,  The wire ones are better and they don’t hurt your ears.
1742,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Best true wir,  I like how the AirPods fast so charge and it’s such good quality
1743,"July 26, 2020",5.0,Best purchases ever!!!,"  These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 10minutes in the case and you have fully charged headphones.I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy one of the greatest purchases I made especially when I go for my weekly runs."
1744,"July 26, 2020",5.0,very good,"  The sound quality is great, much better than the price of the Del headphones on the market, a great product"
1745,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Great buy!
1746,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods,"  Great ear buds, they’re exactly what I ordered and for those who are confused these are real Apple AirPods. The packaging was perfect, they arrived a day after I ordered them, and they sound amazing. Highly recommend."
1747,"July 25, 2020",2.0,Only one works,  Only one of then work
1748,"July 25, 2020",5.0,very light headset with rock solid sound quality!!,"  Although I am huge Apple fan, I was initially skeptical about buying Apple AirPods. I already had a different brand bluetooth headset (which was so-so) and for some reason I didn't have high expectations of AirPods. But these AirPods really beat my expectations. They are light, easily chargeable and have solid sound quality. I mainly use it for business calls from iPhone, and this is just magic! Crystal clear quality, like snowflakes in my ears. I wish I got them earlier!! The only drawback is a bit weird way to check case charge level. You need to open the case in proximity to your iPhone with AirPods in. I find this strange, I wish there was easier and more streamlined way to check it. At any rate, this is a great product and I do recommend it to Apple fans!"
1749,"July 25, 2020",5.0,great,  so nice and easy to use and the price is great :)
1750,"July 25, 2020",2.0,Problems,"  If I could find another brand that works well with apple I would buy it, straight out of the box i've had issues with the air pods charging and connecting with my phone I do like how if one air pod dies you can put on the charging case to charge it and use the other one that is the main reason why I went with these."
1751,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Worth it,"  I love that the case is a charger as well. Once the case is charged you don’t have to leave them plugged in to charge, just throw them into the case for a charge."
1752,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Good deal,  They work great
1753,"July 25, 2020",3.0,Terrible,  Not sure why these are so popular. Feel like they’re going to fall out at any moment. Don’t even think about going for a jog with them.
1754,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Worth it,  Definitely worth the purchase
1755,"July 25, 2020",1.0,Not new!!! Come Amazon,"  They are original but they came not sealed.Dirty , only one airpod.Definitely returning this nonsenseSmh"
1756,"July 25, 2020",5.0,great ear buds,  sound great and charge lasts for hours highly recommend
1757,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Really good,  I like this product a lot well build
1758,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Fast delivery,  Love them
1759,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods are WONDERFUL.,"  There is nothing that I do not love about my Apple AirPods. They are so handy, they are wonderful when I need to hear only my phone. While going to sleep... I cannot boast enough of these AirPods."
1760,"July 25, 2020",1.0,Real But DEFECTIVE,  Real But Was Defective. Only One Side Work and The Other Side Didnt Connect to Phone But Will Charge Just Wont Connect. Bought 2 More Incase They Defective Again. Will Update Soon On July 27.
1761,"July 25, 2020",5.0,"Worth it, in my opinion",  The quality is as you would expect from an apple product and they are a nice upgrade from using wired headphones
1762,"July 25, 2020",5.0,For me these are close to perfect.,"  I've owned four pairs of these over the years and this model has a longer battery life and easier pairing. Since I use them all day I bought two pair and wild ones charging, I'm using the other one. It's really worth it to me to not have to worry about power going out in four hours. Yes I get about four hours of continuous use out of these which is amazing. The sound is excellent from treble to bass. I personally don't like amplified bass in a sealed up and closure in the ear so these work out perfectly for me I prefer them over the pro version that Apple came out with. 10 thumbs up!"
1763,"July 25, 2020",5.0,These are great. Definitely recommended,"  As expected, these are great. Definitely recommended"
1764,"July 25, 2020",4.0,Love them,  My daughter loves these and uses them continually every day.

1770,"July 25, 2020",5.0,APPLE DOES IT AGAIN! Great Headphones,"  Honestly these are very good headphones, they connect super fast to your phone. The audio is decent your usually Apple quality. Very nice and they last a pretty good while as well. I might try the new ones but these are best bang for your buck! Going to buy my mom a pair lol"
1771,"July 25, 2020",5.0,They Work Well,"  The main appeal for me was that the Apple earphone design was actually better fitting for my smaller ears. Silicone tips genuinely bothered me enough that I switched and I'm glad for it. These do work for general sound quality. Honestly the extra mobility I get while I work is what makes these amazing, and the easy connectivity to my phone and laptop!"
1772,"July 25, 2020",5.0,Count. I can’t always count on Amazon to get me what I need.,  The package got to me on time and there was no disappointment anywhere.
1773,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Air pods,  Got for the teen..  she loves them and so far they work great!
1774,"July 24, 2020",3.0,Went on sale and had to buy it,"  When it went on sale on Amazon that's the time I finally bought it. Horrible fitting - too small, great battery life, sound quality is ok, voice activation is good (SIRI) and works well with other Apple products like IPAD and MacBook. Not very discrete design - makes you look like you left a Q-tip on your ears."
1775,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Great,  Gift for my wife. They have great sound quality and she loves them.
1776,"July 24, 2020",5.0,good product,  good product

1778,"July 24, 2020",4.0,Only one con...,  LOVE the great sound quality! Sounds like you’re in a theater - that’s how great the quality is. My only con is the battery life. My buds and case don’t even stay charged a whole day.
1779,"July 24, 2020",2.0,Sound quality,  One plays quieter than the other
1780,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Legit,  I was very skeptical of buying AirPods off of Amazon but I am glad I did. It is from Apple it is legit and brand new.
1781,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Exactly the same as if I bought it from the apple store,"  Literally just another great pair of AirPods from apple. Except this time, you don't have to go all the way to an apple store like the first time."

1783,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Best wireless earbuds out there,  Nice for listening to music while riding dirt bikes
1784,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Love them!,"  I absolutely love my AirPods! I especially love that I can leave my phone at home and listen to music or take phone calls on my watch with them! I haven’t have any trouble and I’ve had them for 7 months! I did buy AppleCare so if something happens, I’ll be covered!"
1785,"July 24, 2020",5.0,High quality of sound,"  I’ve tried another brand with much lower cost (around $40), but I don’t like them at all due to its poor quality accords all spectrums, then I returned it and purchased the Apple Airpods ($130), and it definitely standout without comparison, the sound quality is awesome, and setup is just a snap of finger, and Bluetooth connection is quick with just a click away.  I do agree that Apple products are pricey, but sometime it’s worth the money with the quality built from Apple company."

1791,"July 24, 2020",5.0,"I'm glad I bit the bullet, and purchased the real deal instead of knockoffs.","  I've purchased 3 different knockoffs, and each one was terrible. I ""bit the bullet"", spent the mega amount of money for the ""cadillac"" brand, and am satisfied with the generation one airpods. Unlike the knockoffs, these earbuds don't drop connection, and stay synced with one another. If you're like me, and are hesitant because of the amount of money the apple brand cost, you'll get more for your money buying the official brand. I've spent the same amount collectively on the three other ""airpods"" being $130 instead of buying these in the first place. Now, if we're to look at it like this, in the end I've spent $260 😥 I would include a picture of the airpods, but anyone reading this can just as easily google image search 'apple airpods generation one"". What I received is exactly as described."
1792,"July 24, 2020",5.0,Great Gift!,  My Husband Loves his AirPods. They put him to sleep and helps him get his job done at work with music in his ears!

It's favorite message to me is "" Connection Unsuccessful"" and they are right next to the case if not inside. I soooooo bad want my money back!!!!! I would highly recommend only buy Apple products from The Apple store"

1797,"July 24, 2020",5.0,"Very expensive compared to generics, but they work",  I've bought a few pairs of generic wireless Bluetooth earphones and they have all been a waste of money and don't work. These work. I don't like how they cost so much but I've spent half of the price of these already on others that don't work.
1798,"July 24, 2020",1.0,"Hissing, so so so Much Hissing","  They’re a great product but whenever I play audio there is noticeable Bluetooth hissing that happens before during and slightly after playing audio. I don’t know if this is normal but this is very annoying when I have not had this problem with my wireless headphones.The double tap feature also straight up does not work, this has been a very disappointing purchase so far.Update:Got a replacement pair, all the same problems are still present except now double tap will work. Either I have the worst luck in the world or Apple is duping everyone."
1799,"July 24, 2020",3.0,Let the costumer know there refurbish in the ads,  What I disliked was that they were used and not new. My connected them to her iPhone and they said Chyna AirPods

We are both enjoying the Apple air pods Lol. He said the quality of sound is great and battery charge last about 7-8 hours. The only down side is the noise cancellation, it is not as good as having on headphones but overall he is definitely happy with this purchase."

1820,"July 23, 2020",4.0,"Good product, but pricey","  I love the convenience of not being attached to my phone or computer and still being able to listen or talk on the phone. I have found however the earpieces don't feel quite as secure as the wired apple headphones, so I will readjust them occasionally, but I might just be paranoid because they haven't fallen out. Overall happy with my purchase!"
1821,"July 23, 2020",5.0,Spot on!,  Apple is the best. I got exactly what I paid for.
1822,"July 23, 2020",5.0,Good battery and sound quality,  Bought these for my husband for Father’s Day. He uses them everyday all day at work.  Batteries make it through the day.  Sound quality is great!

1827,"July 23, 2020",5.0,Authentic AirPods for $130 = Good Deal,"  I needed to upgrade my bluetooth headphones and decided to treat myself to these.  They did not disappoint.  The quality is what I would expect from Apple. Came with a lightening cable also.  They have great range and battery life.  My only complaint, and I'm nit picking, is you cannot control the volume directly from the AirPods."
1828,"July 23, 2020",5.0,As expected,"  Wish you could turn off the headphones other then putting them back in the case for standby. Mine came with a charger, I have seen people say they didn’t get one, but it’s underneath the compartment that the case sits in!"

1836,"July 23, 2020",1.0,No charger,"  They didn't come with a wall charger just the power cord , hoping that they can just send it instead of going threw the send back process. The are authentic but I did see that they don't work when you to them to skip or turn up. Smh ! I expected better... Update... I opened the top to put the pods in to charge and the top all of a sudden broke !!! Now I have to change my overall grade for the product. Im officially UPSET !!"
1837,"July 23, 2020",1.0,First edition is better,  Battery doesn’t last and microphone picks up everything except your voice.
1838,"July 23, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  It took me a long time to buy into these wireless earphones. I had another pair and quite frankly the pairing to the Bluetooth was terrible sound quality wasn’t great and the battery was awful. I finally broke down and bought these and could not be more impressed. The sound quality is great and the battery life is amazing
1839,"July 22, 2020",2.0,Uneven battery life / One side dies faster,"  The right side AirPod is dying of battery about twice as fast as the other. As an Apple product consumer, this is very disappointing, especially given the price point."
1840,"July 22, 2020",5.0,BEST EVER!!!,  I absolutely love the AirPods! I have tried a couple of other wireless headphones and these are BY FAR the best! LOVE THEM! Why does Apple have to be so good!? 😵🤣
1841,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Good quality,"  Honestly if you have an iPhone, they’re the best earphones you can get for it"
1842,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Quality product,  The apple AirPods were excellent quality.  Great product and investment!!
1843,"July 22, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Im obsessed with them wear them everyday. Thank you!
1844,"July 22, 2020",1.0,Never worked,"  Bad choice. One of the Airpots never worked, from the first time... I am still trying to change it, since the 30 days passed due to the pandemic."
1845,"July 22, 2020",5.0,good buy,"  even though these airpods do not have noise cancellation, they are very good and convenient to have when on a call and I need to be hands free !"
1846,"July 22, 2020",1.0,Muffled AirPod despite certifies refurbished,  AirPods came refurbished and certified yet upon arrival one of the AirPods had muffled sound. I had to return the item and buy a new pair.
1847,"July 22, 2020",2.0,Didn't last long,"  Very disappointed in how long these lasted, especially with the high cost. Less than three months use and they would not connect to my phone anymore. I wasn't able to get them returned by the window due to a family death."
1848,"July 22, 2020",5.0,AirPods are best,  Love love love my AirPods!! That’s all I have to say. They did hurt my ears initially but I’m accustomed to them now!! I love how I can tap my left AirPod to fast forward a song and tap my right one to repeat the song.
1849,"July 22, 2020",4.0,Cordless and Worth it!,"  The apple ear buds fit my ear well but due to the shape or design of them, they tend to cause a soreness around the ear after wearing them through a medium length workout.(1-2hr)  Though the sound quality is great, there is still some issue with a little outside noise still getting in. Overall worth it! I highly recommend a case that has a clip! As great as these are to use, they are VERY easily misplaced or lost. Spend a few extra dollars and grab a case to keep you from having to repurchase. I also recommend the apple care, If i have learned anything from others in their short weeks f owning their own pair. Easily lost, Not as easy to spend another $100 to replace."
1850,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Best Purchase!,  Worth every penny! I use my Air Pods all of the time!!
1851,"July 22, 2020",1.0,Sound worse than the ones that come iPhone w/o a wire,  They are garbage for $150 absolute trash. Buy a brand that makes headphones for a living sound like the cheap ones they send for free with the iPhone without the wire and to be honest I think worse. This review is mirrored by my wife and four girls
1852,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Bueno,  Bueno
1853,"July 22, 2020",4.0,Not much happy,  They do work but Not much happy with them the battery doesn’t last long..!!!
1854,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Loved it,"  Perfect. No damage at all, bought two of these"
1855,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Don’t listen to the bad reviews,  I read the reviews and got scared but they we fine they came with a charger and where clean I 100% recommended
1856,"July 22, 2020",4.0,Small with Clear Clean Audio,"  Works great with all our Apple devices, nice and seamless connection...sometimes... like anything they have issues and need to be reconnected as they dont do it automatically but when they do its really nice. With aftermarket accessories the Airpods work great for just about any occasion. I love then for work cause I can still hear just fine with my music low if someone needs to talk to me. Battery in the case needs charging often with normal use which is not a huge deal but I find myself with dead earphone all to often as the case doesnt stay charged very long between uses."
1857,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Great Apple product,  Love them
1858,"July 22, 2020",5.0,"If You Don't Dig In-Ear Silicone, These are Awesome","  I'm the first to be an Apple Griever where applicable (f*** that iphone notch!), but these pods are phenomenal and I could not be happier with them. I'd go even as far to agree they're ""magical"".Remember when you were a kid with your snaz ipod/mp3 player and those ol' wired headphones? You would think, ""golly gosh, how cool would it be if these headphones had NO CORDS and just somehow PLAYED JAMS in my DOME?""Well the future of my ruddy-cheeked boyhood dreams is here, and there is something undeniably neat about the buds vanishing on the sides of your ears without a detectable trace from a head swivel.All this can be said about any truly wireless buds though. What I personally like about these is what many don't prefer: their airy non-sealed fit.I've already got big noise-cancelling cans to put over the ears for hardcore music seshes and studio/field work. I wanted an alternative for biking, walking, and for just sort of existing with the addition of quality background music.These don't seal off your ability to hear like airpod pros and almost every other earbud on the market, so you could listen to tunes and also talk to friends simultaneously without the need of ""passive mode"".I also plan on using these for phone calls quite often, and if you've tried doing such with silicon in-ear buds it's like trying to talk to someone with your fingers plugged into your head (like you're talking underwater lol)This design does take away from bass and punchy sound capabilities of in-ear models, but that said sound quality is still terrific on these. Mids and Highs are especially nice and clear and there's still a good amount of fullness noticeably better than the traditional wired apple earpods.And the freaking case is absolute fidget-toy evocative of eMacs and white Macbooks remembered fondly.All said I am late but absolutely on the airpod bandwagon, and if you don't like the ear-plunger style of earphones save yourself some money and get these!"
1859,"July 22, 2020",1.0,Very dissatisfied,  They don’t work. Should have used the Apple store. Highly suspicious that they are non functional and repackaged in Apple packaging
1860,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Amazing as a hands-free.,"  Bought these as a hands-free with intent to mostly use only one earpiece. Partly because my ears are clearly a bit different and while right bud sits tight, the other one falls out almost immediately while on the move. But the one that doesn't fills like it was made for that ear. Nice, snug and comfortable. It doesn't even make any attempts to fall out. Almost every aspect is perfect for what they were bought. Sound quality, distance (from iPhone), battery life, size, weight, ergonomics. My only complaint is price ofc. This can be said about all Apple products.Never intended to use them for music for obvious reasons, but I must say I expected them to sound way worse, than they do. For an average Joe they sound very decent. Still if you value sound quality, I would look elsewhere. These are clearly not for music enthusiasts.Bottom line. If you need earbuds for your iPhone mostly for the phone calls and occasionally to listen the music, look no further. Taken they will hold in your ears nice an snug, which I suggest you to find out before buying them."
1861,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods with Wired ChargIng,  My son loves his AirPods. Great purchase
1862,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  I’m soo excited! I love this item! the shipping came so fast nice job
1863,"July 22, 2020",2.0,Poor battery life,  battery only last about 6 hours
1864,"July 22, 2020",5.0,OMG,"  So I am not sure how I have really lived without these babies. I seriously had tried so many knock offs and they just didn't work or last but these! The sound quality is amazing, They are easy to use and now there is no going back. I will never not own these. They stay in my ears well and when I am on the phone I am heard clearly"
1865,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Go buy it,  Perfect
1866,"July 22, 2020",5.0,Me encanta,  Excelente
1867,"July 22, 2020",4.0,small and you can make them cute,  They are great and comfortable they also have good sound compared to other wireless earbuds. They also come with a charger and the AirPods then self’s are gen 2
1868,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Calidad de 2 generación.,"  Llegaron a tiempo, la verdad es que laBatería de la generación dura más , el sonido es espectacular , fue una buena invención."
1869,"July 21, 2020",5.0,WOULD BUY AGAIN!,"  perfect condition in the box and all sealed, very worth my money. I do recommend."
1870,"July 21, 2020",3.0,Wish they would write more in description,  The left side is damaged. You don’t notice it if you’re listening to music but as soon as you get a call all that is heard on both ends is loud static. I was bummed out with the way they came as well... didn’t look very clean. I was a fool for purchasing these.
1871,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Easily connects with your apple devices,"  I've had blue tooth ear buds before but they alway had some clunkiness in connecting with different devices. Well, now a days I guess i'm completely on Apple and have no problems switching between my iphone and my macbook. In addition the microphone and speaker quality is pretty solid.It's only been a couple of months in but it's definitely worth the extra coin."
1872,"July 21, 2020",5.0,"Charge them first, if u don’t hear sound from one AirPod charge them and then it should work",  It was Ight
1873,"July 21, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Great Apple product. I’m pleased
1874,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Gift,  My son loves them great sound and last a long time
1875,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Quality sound,  None
1876,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Great design and easy to connect with all Apple products!
1877,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Es bueno té saca de apuro,  Bien de todo
1878,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Rocking..,  Daughter received it for doing good in school.  Loves this present...
1879,"July 21, 2020",1.0,Stopped working,  Got these as a gift in January. The left one just stopped working. So disappointed.
1880,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Wonderful sound quality,  I’m too excited to come review this product without testing the battery life or the noise cancellation.Just wanted to come on here and say music usually gives me a headache after listening for a while BUT these earphones make the music sound soo beautiful and I havent got a headache. So this is what quality music is. Love
1881,"July 21, 2020",4.0,AirPods,  They to me are worth the money personally because I used to use Apple wired headphones and they would break within 2 months. So far since I got these I have had no issues. Also they are legitimate from Apple.
1882,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Dope.,  I only wanted the pods so I could get this Pain case! Worth every penny! Buuuuuut I feel like the knock off ones I got were louder...
1883,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Love them,"  My daughter loves them, she can listen to music & watch videos, & the stay charged a very long time"
1884,"July 21, 2020",4.0,Like the Airpod 2 since you can hear around you,"  These Airpods have good sound quality and the microphone functions well for conference calls and video conferencing.  Good noise cancelation of backgound noise which improves how others hear you during a call.  I like the open-ear design so you can hear what's going on around you.  The downside is battery life during a call is only 3 hours, much longer when listening to music.  My biggest complaint is these really only connect with one device at a time.  My other bluetooth devices connect with 2 or more devices simultaneously.  Therefore to change devices you have to force the connection and sometime when I start my computer it unexpectedly steals the connection."
1885,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Quality,  Quality at it’s finest :)
1886,"July 21, 2020",2.0,After 20 days of use the right ear bud stop working I would not recommend buying this product,  Would never buy again
1887,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Original Apple product,  The only complaint I ha us the duration of battery. Literally no more than two hours of use. Besides that this is an original apple product (at least the ones i got) very practical! Sound amazing and its just easier to carry around!
1888,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Excellent!!,  Arrive quickly and are originals ❤️ Recommended!!
1889,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Good for exercising,  Battery life is not that long. if I do a two hour walk the battery is almost deadmaybe the battery is not suppose to last long then two hours
1890,"July 21, 2020",5.0,"Great Buy, looking forward to using everyday!",  I loved that it came one day early! Five stars because it connected so easily and automatically. All I had to do was turn on my music and it connected to my phone. Looking forward to using it during classes and meetings this week. Can’t believe it took me so long to decide to get them. Very convenient and worth the money.
1891,"July 21, 2020",2.0,Horrible Refund Time Frame,  Brought these but they won't stay in my ear like normal people earlobes. So I returned them 2 weeks ago and still haven't got my refund
1892,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Honestly really hard to live without,  I'm an Android user no less.. But having BT earbuds that literally switch on whenever I take them out of the case is a blessing. I bring these everywhere I go. I was a skeptic before but I have been converted...
1893,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Get very loud!,  These are great! Can listen to music while mowing.
1894,"July 21, 2020",4.0,Nice but some complications,  I’ve had them for awhile and they work but occasionally I had to reset them because the sound wouldn’t work. Still a good buy.
1895,"July 21, 2020",3.0,Better off buying from Apple,  Strange high pitched noise in right airpod
1896,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods!,"  Very rarely the sound will be a little wonky, but it’s SUPER rare (and it could just have to do with me having an older phone), but besides that, great product! Awesome for exercising, sleeping, reading, or doing pretty much anything! Very comfortable and great quality!"
1897,"July 21, 2020",5.0,so clear and quiet,  I was amazed at the quiet and sharp sound these have..well worth the cost
1898,"July 21, 2020",1.0,How they stay in your ear,  The only thing that I did not like is that both my husband and I both lost one. Do not like they do not stay in your ear.
1899,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Great gift for Mother's / Father's Day,"  I personally already have headphones that I am sponsored by but I wanted to get these for my Mother due to the easy of connecting them to an Apple Device. Very Seamless, great battery life, work with just one headphone"
1900,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,"  These AirPods are perfect. They sound great they charge great and actually holds a charge. When you are on the phone and looking at a video, it actually cancels out the person that is on the phone. I’ve had them for a couple months now and I love them. ( I left my other AirPod in the bathroom)"
1901,"July 21, 2020",1.0,Phone microphone issue because other party can barely hear me,"  After using these for about 2 weeks, the phone aspect no longer works properly.  The person on the other line will say that I sound like I'm 100 feet away when talking to them.  I bought these for work conference calls at home, so they're worthless to me now.  I bought them on May 22 and the return window closes on May 31 on Amazon, so if they work fine for 2 weeks and then break, you cannot return them.  I've googled my issue and there are tons and tons of people with the same problem.  Save you money here or buy them from Costco which has a much better return policy (without having to spend more money on a warranty)."
1902,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Works very well... if you like to hear some of your surroundings.,"  The AirPods work excellent as long as you like to hear your surroundings. If you are used to Apples earphones that come with your phone, you'll feel comfortable with these. Being an Apple product, they obviously work great with your Apple iPhone."
1903,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Upgraded from off brand. Loving my AirPods.,  I usually listen to one headphone at a time because I have to hear my surroundings at work. But I love them. Headphones sync pretty much automatically. Fully charged one easily lasts my 8 hour work day. If it dies I just put it in the case to charge and switch ears. Have not tried using for phone calls yet. Would definitely recommend.
1904,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Good,  Bought this for my husband for his birthday seeing as he damaged his first pair. I don't know about sound quality or anything but he has no complaints. I'm sure if they were different from the first pair bought through apple he would have let me know.
1905,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Apple of My Eye,  Love AirPods for music and conversing on the phone! Easy to use and provides great flexibility while going about daily tasks!
1906,"July 21, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Absolutely love mine
1907,"July 20, 2020",4.0,"comfortable on ear, each to use","  The quality, apple product."
1908,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Worth the purchase!,"  I have been eyeing these for a while now and I am glad I made the purchase! They are lightweight, sleek and fits quite snug in my ears! I have used them casually for a couple days now and love the battery life with the case and the airpods and I'm looking forward to using them while I work out."
1909,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Very happy,  Love them
1910,"July 20, 2020",4.0,Noise cancellation is dope.,  The volume isn’t very dynamic. But noise cancellation kind of makes up for it. Don’t get it if you have trouble with the type of headphones you put in your ear.
1911,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Just what I wanted.,  Exactly what I expected!
1912,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  Got these because I lost my first pair of AirPods and I love them. Came in a decent amount of time
1913,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Great gift for my friend,"  I had one pair of the Airpod for myself, and I really like it a lot. So I bought this one for my friend's birthday. I have bought it for a while and just gave it to my friend last weekend for his birthday. He likes it so much."
1914,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Outstanding sound quality,  I never used to use a earphone. But after getting this one. I liked it very much. I started using AirPod on regular basis. The sound quality is pretty good. Better life is also good.
1915,"July 20, 2020",1.0,Broken AirPods that never worked got charged  . Hope you don’t get this,"  These AirPods never and I mean never connected to any of our phones. I spent a combination of close to 4 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved. Finally, amazon said I could return them (after we waited for Apple to answer our call for an hour.) overjoyed, we packaged them up and mailed only to find out we lost $30 of what my sixteen year old daughter paid. Restocking fee? They were BROKEN. Amazon- this is shady and so unlike you. My daughter worked super hard to earn her money mowing lawns. You just made her mow four more lawns to rebuy the same headphones. Pretty rotten."
1916,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Great product for a great price,  Works great and has a long battery life.
1917,"July 20, 2020",5.0,A great gift for a teen,  Our granddaughter loves them!
1918,"July 20, 2020",1.0,"Broke after 1 month, amazon wouldn’t send replacement pair.",  Left air-pod stopped working after 1 month. Was sent a replacement pair. That pair stopped working after 1 month (same issue). Attempted to return and amazon said it was out of the return window. DO NOT BUY. Go directly to Apple.
1919,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Nice sound,  Love love love them!!!
1920,"July 20, 2020",1.0,Fake,  These have to be fake. They cut in and out constantly and I’m unable to use them

1923,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Excelente producto.,"  Excelente dispositivo, te brinda una fidelización en el audio y son súper cómodos, valió la pena la inversión."
1924,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Seem legit to me,  Lot of reviews here about potential fakes. Purchased the wired charging case with led on inside. (Wireless has led on outside). Tested the Functionality and watched quite a few videos before checking serial numbers/model number(S) (on each individual AirPod) with apple to confirm that everything matched up and to me they appear to be legit apple airpods.
1925,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Kids love them,  My kids love their air pods!
1926,"July 20, 2020",5.0,the quality is most important,"  This apple product is the best, I tried to get the cheap one, but very disappointed."
1927,"July 20, 2020",5.0,BEST BUY EVER,  Apple products do exactly what is expected!!
1928,"July 20, 2020",5.0,accessibility,  sound
1929,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Valued apple product,"  This is the best-valued product so far that I was used, I am a big fan of the apple products. but the sound quality is not that good, overall the price was ok, its convenient to keep it in your pocket"
1930,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Amazing product,  Obsessed with these! Been wanting these for the longest time and of course amazon never fails to deliver. Such a great price and I use these for everything ! Thanks amazon!
1931,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Very convenient! Apple products always are of great quality!,  Great to use while multi-tasking!
1932,"July 20, 2020",3.0,Replace,  It’s good product but it’s losing battery so fast oh I went to every store and they told me it’s a problem from the manufacture and they recommend me to send you guys I review so I can get this one replaced.
1933,"July 20, 2020",5.0,airpods,  airpods go well with my iphone
1934,"July 20, 2020",5.0,Definitely worth it,  Great condition. Received it pretty fast.
1935,"July 20, 2020",3.0,Drop Out Alot,  Not sure if it's just me but these pair funky; especially if you have multiple Apple Devices. Also I was on an important phone call and they completely dropped out. This is not the first time I have experienced this with Airpods. A bit surprised to be honest. Apple is usually top notch.
1936,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Nice small pare of Bluetooth headphones.,"  They do exactly what you expect, there high quality, good Noise cancellation, nice bass and over all sound i used them at work all day head phone themself never died and when I would put one away it would charge pretty quick back to 100%. I would recommend this to someone who wants small but good sounding Bluetooth headphones."
1937,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Works great 👍,  Very happy with this purchase.  👍👍
1938,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Stop thinking about it and buy these!,"  I love them!!! Best ear buds ever! Game changer. Sound is perfect, battery lasts forever. Love love love"

1940,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Feel good,  Good things worth buying
1941,"July 19, 2020",2.0,Not very happy,  I just bought these not long ago maybe used 5-8 times and the left AirPod is now not working.
1942,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Last all day with excellent sound,  I wear these at work they sound great and dont fall out and are hardly noticeable
1943,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Battery dies soon but charges fast,  Is good overall battery doesn’t last too long but charges fast
1944,"July 19, 2020",1.0,Poor finishing quality,  There are obvious seams for both units. Seems that they were misaligned. Contacted Apple and was told the quality is within the design standard. I am considering having an exchange but I may never get a good one. Disappointed at the quality control.I have several pairs of EarPods with much better build quality.
1945,"July 19, 2020",5.0,"Great product from Apple, What Mom says!!! 😂","  So my mom used to take my old Apple headphones all the time cause the fit comfortably for here was always a pain lol so she has been looking for a good pair of ear buds for a long time. She’s not a tech person at all, so I thought these would be great for her sense she always took my old pair.So for Mother’s Day I got her a pair, oh boy I hit it right on the money. She absolutely enjoys them 100%, she tells me every time I see her how great they are. She wears one at work, uses them doing outside chores, going for walks, listening to books and so much more. The sound quality is better that your old ones and being wireless is so much more productive in life. Haven’t heard a complaint about them so far, so I recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds."
1946,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  Very nice ear buds
1947,"July 19, 2020",1.0,I don't think this is an original apple product.,"  After a week of using these AirPods:  they seemed to be refurbished or second hand or not original apple product despite they are sold as new. Poor quality, battery last less than 2 hours, and also i've felt  some pain in the ears even after 20-30 minutes use, I am very disappointed. I do not recommend."
1948,"July 19, 2020",1.0,Item not working properly,  This products sound is too low. Can barely hear and cannot turn up volume. I think it was not working right from the beginning. Too late to return.
1949,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Purchased as gift,  Receiver very happy!
1950,"July 19, 2020",5.0,AirPods brand new right out the box,  I really like these AirPods they look like they just came out the store. If your really looking to but AirPods buy this one. There is no damage They are brand new

1954,"July 19, 2020",3.0,Faulty,  My only problem is the right earbud stopped working a few weeks in.
1955,"July 19, 2020",5.0,So glad I have Apple Air pads.,  Complete quality product.
1956,"July 19, 2020",1.0,Left earbud not charging,"  I just bought these for my husband for Father’s Day and the left earbud won’t consistently charge.  He’s already had to do his workouts four times now with only one earbud working and he only works out three times a week for about an hour each time.  We don’t know whether there is a problem with the case or the actual earbud, but the right bud will be 100% charged and the left will be at 1%.  We’ve missed the 30 day return window so I don’t know what to do."
1957,"July 19, 2020",5.0,perfect!,  Bought as a gift for my friend! Very nice. Excellent price!
1958,"July 19, 2020",5.0,Best AirPods in the world,"  Something I always wanted , best quality best mic best charging , I love them , although they are expensive extremely"
1959,"July 18, 2020",4.0,Great Bluetooth earbuds but noise cancellation is limited.,"  Love the AirPods, I’ve been using the same pair for two years now with no issues. Battery life is great and usually last me 4 days of 8 hour use at work, and they charge up in a matter of minutes! Sound quality is alright but doesn’t match earbuds that make a seal in your ear. My one complaint is that there is almost no sound cancellation and while working with machinery at work I have to turn the volume all the way up. So if you are looking for a earbud to block out ambient noise, look elsewhere or possibly get the AirPod pros. As for build quality these are amazing, I have never had any problems within the two years I’ve owned them. I even dropped them in a lake and they were completely fine (although they are not waterproof so don’t use them in wet applications)."
1960,"July 18, 2020",4.0,"Great item, but a bit pricey","  I think we all know how Apple air-pods work and the great features they have. I was not disappointed in the features at all and air-pods worked great. As with all Apple products, the price is just a bit much for what you get, but hey its Apple!"
1961,"July 18, 2020",1.0,Defective,"  Left earphone came defective, absolutely no sound."
1962,"July 18, 2020",5.0,Music quality.,  Came fast.

1964,"July 18, 2020",5.0,A good product,  They were for my girls and they loved it was a good Investment
1965,"July 18, 2020",5.0,Happy I Bought Them,"  Sound quality is good. I love how smoothly my AirPods synced up with my iPhone straight out of the box and pair immediately when I put them in my ears. There is not really any noise cancellation, but these do t really claim to so I don’t hold that against them. They are surprisingly comfortable to wear. I use them for work because I am on the phone my entire shift. The battery life is about 2 hours when talking on the phone before needing charged. I wish this was longer. Nice thing is I can take one out and have it charging then switch and charge the other, all without interrupting my calls. Really, only complaint is battery life, but I get it. They are small and wireless. Where would they store more energy? I’m sure that will improve with newer versions."

1985,"July 18, 2020",5.0,These rock,"  I know you can get nice alternatives for far less $.  I tried 2 such options.  I returned both.  Thing is, if you have the money to pay far more for these, and IF you have an iphone, get airpods.  These darned things work so seamlessly with my iphone that it makes the ""upcharge"" worth every penny."
1986,"July 18, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,  They work great!! So glad I got them.
1987,"July 17, 2020",5.0,Great gift,  My daughter loves the quality

1993,"July 17, 2020",2.0,One ear only,  I got the product and only could hear with one side. What a disappointment. Hopefully I’ll be able to exchange them.

1995,"July 17, 2020",5.0,Don’t buy the offbrands. We tried.,  5th set for the 5th member of the house. Nothing but good luck and things to say this far. Some are original design and still kicking
1996,"July 17, 2020",5.0,The best wireless earbuds for iPhones!!!,"  The sounds quality is great, has a compact form factor, pairs extremely fast, and is super convenient. I read reviews saying these were AirPods 1 but these are AirPods 2, I discovered that after looking at the model number. Buy the pros if you want noise cancellation and better sound quality."
1997,"July 17, 2020",5.0,Great airpods,  Entertainment and wireless use.
1998,"July 17, 2020",1.0,fake,  Its been 2 months i buy this product and i havent use it much. I charge it at night it shows full charge and tomorrow in the evening i try to use it and the battery 0 without using.I want to return it please

2002,"July 17, 2020",5.0,I hear you,"  First I appreciate the wonder drivers at Amazon as I always get my packages.  Love the airpods, had some and lost them.  None of the imitations work."
2003,"July 17, 2020",5.0,"Comfortable, great sound and battery power","  Great product.  The fact that the case can hold a charge is awesome.  I honestly rarely plug the charger in, because the charge from the case keeps the headphones juiced for many hours.  Great sound, but noise cancellation doesn't seem too great.  But it's about as good as I'd expect it to be, given that they're not over-ear headphones.  Haven't worn them during exercise yet but they fit very well in my ear and I believe they'd stay in place while running/working out."
2004,"July 17, 2020",2.0,ear bud isn't working properly,  I bought these for a Christmas present and 6 months later the right ear pod isn't working properly
2005,"July 17, 2020",3.0,Work Well,"  Periodically they turn off.  The batter shouldn't be dead, but they just stop working.  Very frustrating when on a phone call."

2007,"July 17, 2020",3.0,So Angry,  Don’t connect fast. Slow. Die fast.
2008,"July 17, 2020",5.0,Good to pair with iPhone,  Good to pair with iPhone... nice quality and sound... but apple needs to fix the issue of the support inside the ear... they fall down Easy.
2009,"July 17, 2020",1.0,Airpods y aseguranza. La peor compra.,  La peor compra es los Airpods y la supuesta aseguranza de Apple.  Son costosos. No tienen mucha duración y cuando solicitas te hagan efectiva la SUPUESTA aseguranza te dicen que solo cubre daños no perdida y que un solo airpods cuesta más de la mitad. Conclusión. Esto no sirve.
2010,"July 17, 2020",5.0,I am an Apple fan,"  I love these AirPods. They are very convenient. If you are running heavy equipment I would say no, but for my days off they are great! Easy to carry, charge and use."
2011,"July 17, 2020",1.0,Faulty charging case,"  Ordered back in May 2020 charging case isn’t working as of July 2020 so the return window is closed had to go through apple support and they wanted $70 to replace the charging case on top of the $130+ that I had already spent that would make $200. All I needed was what I payed for, which is a working AirPod case the Earbuds still work. So thanks but no thanks. This is the second pair I’ve gone through from the year prior, I feel absolutely cheated out of my money so yes I am leaving a bad review for the faulty product you sold me. Don’t bother at this point trying to make it right."
2012,"July 17, 2020",2.0,Defective,  The right airpod completely stopped working.

2016,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Great ear buds,  My daughter love it. It work great. And someone ended up stealing it from her.
2017,"July 16, 2020",3.0,Pairing to a phone breaks any connection to a PC,  If you want to pair this with a PC and also use it for your phone then the phone mode with a microphone that greatly decreases the sound quality will be forced on you when using with the PC until you completely disable it on the PC and re-pair it every time.
2018,"July 16, 2020",2.0,"Do not get sweaty, will ruin mic",  Microphone stopped functioning within a few months. Second time

2028,"July 16, 2020",5.0,They're so easy to carry on,"  I'm so happy I bought them. This AirPods made my life easy. I used them all the time, especially when I work because I can block the noise and concentrate in what I'm doing.  I also used them to run and to exercise."
2029,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Comfortable Ear Pods,"  These ear pods are a great value, comfortable, even when sweating and the sound quality is great!"
2030,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Great,"  Exactly as advertised, Apple AirPods. Great for music and I don’t have to worry about wires :)"
2031,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Headphones are perfect,  Had some extra money and needed some headphones badly! Went to Apple and saw they were $169 I couldn’t bring myself to spend that much on some headphones... came to amazon and found them for $139 and even had money leftover to buy a case. They came pretty fast and I regret nothing!! Headphones are perfect.
2032,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Nice!,  thought product was fake but it is genuine
2033,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Quality,"  Am very disappointed with the ipods. I can’t get volume in the right pod, and not much in the left pod. Would like a replacement or a credit."
2034,"July 16, 2020",2.0,"EARS ARE NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL, VERY VERY LIMITED BATTERY LIFE","  These ear pods are wonderful in quality of sound, ease of use.  I particularly like how you just lift it into your ear and it knows to switch.  I have not figured out how to answer and end a call without having to tap the phone, but haven’t looked it up.  Tapping the airpod activates the music and switches the song, which is nice, but I have to find out if I can stop music play.Downside:  Battery life is surprisingly and disappointingly brief.  I used them for a phone call that lasted about 1 1/2 hours.  The buds went dead before the call was finished!Ears are not one size fits all.  I must be careful when using them or they will fall out of my ear.  Having to pay an additional $100 for the “pro"" model, which is supposed to have adjustable fittings, is a rip off.  It’s like buying a pair of shoes, advertised at $100.  “Oh, you want them in YOUR size?  Well, that will be an additional $100.""  So, if purchasing these, beware of the fit.I will not recommend these or purchase again."
2035,"July 16, 2020",1.0,Do Not Invest in These,"  Do not waste your money on buying these. They are passive, which means you hear everything around you so no matter how high you turn up the volume, you'll be able to hear everything around you.The microphone is TERRIBLE. On video call meetings I get complaints that the audio is fuzzy when I talk and that I sound like a robot. Keep in mind these are paired to a brand new 2019 Apple MacBook Pro, so there should be no issues, yet there are. If these can't work with a product that the SAME manufacturer produces I can only imagine how bad they are if you're on PC.Battery life is also horrible, they die within a few hours of being charged and they get you with the gimmick that the case extends the battery life to over a day or something. Dont fall for this marketing ploy. Sad waste of ~$150. Wish I had bought something else."
2036,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Excellent
2037,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Worth every penny,"  I’ve been through a few Bluetooth earbuds/headphones and finally got these. Seamless Bluetooth connectivity, long battery life, and decent noise cancellation."
2038,"July 16, 2020",5.0,They work great but battery life could be a lot better.,  I love them but I wish battery life was longer. They usually need a charge after 2 hours of use.

2041,"July 16, 2020",5.0,These are Gen 2- apple website confirmed,  These are AirPod gen 2!!! I read all the mixed reviews before buying them. All the people saying they’re the gen 1 don’t mention why they think that. I made this purchase based off one review where the person said they looked up the serial number and it was gen 2. I looked up my serial number on the apple website and they come up as gen 2.
2042,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Great sound quality and battery life,  Love the AirPods!!!!
2043,"July 16, 2020",5.0,You get what you pay for,"  Why did I wait so long, I bought plenty of knock off brands. Nothing compares to the real thing.The microphones work incredibly well.I have to get used to the stems but but that’s something I’m willing to do.Or the quality The carrying case is super small compact definitely surprised By that"

2045,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Good ones
2046,"July 16, 2020",1.0,Can you hear me?,"  I purchased these airpods when I got tired of being told I sounded ""garbled"", ""far away in a room"" and ""very quiet"".  I can narrow the problem down to the left airpod.  If I remove it then I can be heard fine.  I did not pay for one airpod however.  I'm confident Apple will blame the dysfunction on something else as is their modus operandi, even though I have an iphone."
2047,"July 16, 2020",5.0,Great as Expected.,  This is an Apple product so what can you say. They work perfectly as advertised. Phone function is crystal clear. Music is clear Range from source is sufficient. I’m going to order more for family members.I am impressed but sincerely didn’t expect less performance.

Very bad design.The ear pods themselves are good.  The case is just terrible. Easily scratches, impossible to clean once dirty as there are so many grooves and places for dirt to get into.

2089,"July 14, 2020",2.0,"Unreliable, in my case :>(","  These were great for 5-3/4 months. Then the charging got wonky. Suddenly, after leaving the airpods charging overnight, one or the other airpod would give me a low battery warning 5 minutes after removing them from the case. Then the next charge would be fine. Repeat whole process. Very disappointed in this product. Because of COVID, I can't take them into the local Apple Store. Instead, I get a $220 hold on my credit card, and wait for a refurb unit. I should have the hold removed once they get my defective unit back. I won't buy these again. If you do buy them, I strongly recommend the AppleCare (which you must buy within the first 60 days of placing your order.)"

2093,"July 14, 2020",5.0,"Great pair of wireless headphones. If you're an iPhone user, get these.","  I have to be honest. I used to poke fun at these, and the people who wore them, every time I saw them. I never thought I’d actually own a pair. However, I had become very frustrated with the pairing capabilities of some cheaper wireless headphones I owned. Sometimes they would take a very long time to pair, other times they wouldn’t pair at all. It was even more difficult to pair them with my MacBook. I had watched video reviews and heard many positive things about the AirPods, especially their convenient fast pairing abilities. I had some extra $ lying around so I decided to purchase them. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly they paired with my iPhone. Not only that but I could easily pair them with my Mac if I decided to switch. I’ve heard that Android users may want to look elsewhere in purchasing wireless headphones, but for iPhone users, I would say that these AirPods are the best way to go. Extreme audiophiles who care about sound quality the most won’t be blown away by how these sound, but if you’re looking for a convenient wireless headphone to use throughout your day, look no further than these."

2127,"July 13, 2020",3.0,I want to..,"  I want to like these more than I do because I got them for the gym and unless my phone is right by the pods, they just cut out? Like in my pocket is too far. Regardless if on wifi or my own data, its almost as if the Bluetooth connection itself is compromised in the gym because its also reagrdless if its my own saved music or Spotify. This mainly only ocurs in the gym, everywhere else they work pretty well. Still, pretty lame😣"
2128,"July 13, 2020",1.0,Airpods - Cut out and voice quality not good,"  I had previously owned Apple Airpods and they were excellent.  As they got older, they stopped holding a charge.  I bought another set.  They began as i expected.  However after 3 month, they started cutting out when listening to music and the voice quality on phone calls is bad.  People indicate they can't clearly hear me.  I am in a room with no real ambient noise so i don't understand.I am very disappointed in this product.  Also, the window to return is closed so i can't get my money back.  I am very disappointed in Apple and Amazon."
2129,"July 13, 2020",5.0,It is the Apple airpod.,  Good airpod.

2140,"July 13, 2020",5.0,Legit!!!!!,"  Before buying these I did hesitate. Getting electronics online never comes across my mind but I’m glad I made this purchase. They came with instructions and a charger, everything pictured above. I’m happy to say that these are indeed the real deal. Worth every penny."
2141,"July 13, 2020",2.0,Semi decent sometimes.,"  Semi decent when they actually connect. Sound quality is so-so and over half the time I go to use them, they don't connect to my phone. I end up having to put them back in the case and take them out again, 4-5 times before they will connect. The low battery indicator stopped working after six months, so now I just have to guess.Overall, I wouldn't recommend. Get a cheaper knock-off."
2142,"July 13, 2020",3.0,AirPods take forever to connect,  AirPods are crap. Half the time I try to use then they don’t connect to my phone. I have a good internet connection and my Bluetooth is on but nothing happens.

2145,"July 12, 2020",1.0,Died after 4 months.,  I don't know if these Apple AirPods are Apple OEM product or not but they died after 4 month so use. Very disappointed. I should have bought them from Apple website next time to make sure they are.

2148,"July 12, 2020",4.0,Awesome after messing with cheaper knock offs,"  Yeah I love the Apple AirPods - the sounds is great, the bass is awesome. Battery life is ok but I keep them close the case which is always on a charger. Haven't tried wireless charging yet. I get a lot of complaints about the call becoming muffled and my voice disappearing - I quickly adjust and they say it is fine again."
2149,"July 12, 2020",5.0,Excellent Turnaround,  I washed my child’s AirPods :(. I ordered these and they are excellent quality and we received them quickly
2150,"July 12, 2020",5.0,Product experience is great,  The product experience is great and worth recommending!

2154,"July 12, 2020",5.0,Great gift!,  My boyfriend got it for his niece and she was super excited and loved it!!!
2155,"July 12, 2020",1.0,Might be defective :/,  I’m not sure how legit these are. My boyfriend purchased his headphones from Walmart and we did a comparison as far as how long these things hold charge. Today I disconnected my headphones early in the morning. We were both at 100% at 12pm now 8pm and he’s at 80% and I’m at 30%  I spent a lot of money on these like everyone else. Last thing I want to do is to keep exchanging something I had less than a week 🤨
2156,"July 12, 2020",5.0,Good product,  Came as described.
2157,"July 12, 2020",4.0,The battery life,"  I love the headphones because they don’t hurt my ears! However, it does fall off from my ear a couple of times and it’s not  adjustable. The battery life is better than the iPhone max pro. They last about 6 1/2 hours"
2158,"July 12, 2020",4.0,Great headphone for daily use,  Excellent quality. Easy to connect and use. Pretty comfortable to my ears while doing indoor/outdoor activities. The sound quality isn't the best for headphones at this price but the convenience is where you will be satisfied.

2164,"July 12, 2020",5.0,Great Product!,"  This is a fantastic set of headphones.  I was very hesistant to spend this kind of money for headphones but they are well worth it.  They are very comfortable and I would buy them again and again.I use these for working out, normal wear, and even doing yard work and mowing the lawn.  I can hear them loud and clear while mowing my lawn and they do not slip out or wiggle around.  If you are on the fence regarding purchsing these due to the price, you will not regret it and should buy them!  They are a gamechanger."
2165,"July 12, 2020",5.0,No more worse being caught on anything fantastic,  These are the best thing since sliced bread great product. Happy happy happy. Fantastic . Not having wires when working is great I would recommend these to everybody thanks

2175,"July 11, 2020",1.0,Poor Product,  Bad product. I ordered for my daughter and start cutting off on sound just after a month.  Paid $130 for it.
2176,"July 11, 2020",5.0,It is a bit exspensive.  Not so sure it is worth the amount of money it sells for.,  The watch has served my purpose.  The ipods has great sound quality.y

2182,"July 11, 2020",5.0,The best wireless headphones,"  Love these AirPods. They are authentic and have great sound quality! I was getting tired of using the wire headphones that came with my phone, so I finally gave in and bought airpods as a gift to myself for starting college. Best decision ever! Super easy to bring around and are very discreet, plus you can track them! The battery life on these are also insane. They charge super fast and I don’t need to charge the charging case for a couple days at a time. I will be repurchasing in the future if anything happens to these!"
2183,"July 10, 2020",5.0,Get it,  Love them. Can’t beat the price. Legit!!
2184,"July 10, 2020",4.0,Easy to use,  Like it but sometimes can’t hear the. Sounds
2185,"July 10, 2020",5.0,Comfort and Quality,  Bought these for my son for Christmas and they are constantly in his ears. He LOVES them. I bought a cheap knockoff and while they sounded good they hurt my ears. I tried my son's and they are way comfy. Highly recommend!
2186,"July 10, 2020",5.0,BUY IT,"  One of the best purchases I’ve ever made. It has drastically improved my life. If you’re on the fence, you should buy this! It’s worth it"
2187,"July 10, 2020",5.0,Very Satisfied!,  Love It!❤️Thank you to Amazon Prime for quick and speedy delivery!
2188,"July 10, 2020",1.0,Had to buy twice...still don't work,"  This is the second pair purchased and looks like I just missed the return window.  Sucks because for some reason both pairs purchased did not work properly.  The charge will not stay, when speaking they cut out or in and out altogether.  Now it looks like I am stuck with Airpods that I bought as a birthday gift for my mother that do not work.  Out $140+ taxes and shipping if it applied.  Just buy from Apple and save yourself the headache."
2189,"July 10, 2020",5.0,BUENA INVERSION,"  FUNCIONA BIEN, ES UTIL, Y TENIA DESCUENTO CUANDO LO COMPRE"
2190,"July 10, 2020",5.0,Great Sound,  They're definitely authentic I love them so much great sound these are my first pair ever and I love them
2191,"July 10, 2020",5.0,Exceptional quality,"  As with everything Apple, these are amazing. They are the only ones that fit my ears, and the sound quality is exceptional."
2192,"July 10, 2020",5.0,I got these for my husband,"  My husband is ill and spends a lot of time in doctors offices and hospital waiting rooms.....hours and hours.  In the old days I would go with him and we would chat, but now in Covid land I am not allowed in the hospital or doctors offices.....And I am sure you have all had the experience of the crazy lady who can spend hours chatting on her cell at the top of her voice.  It is torture.  So I purchased these for my husband to drowned out her voice and stay calm listening to music.  The perfect solution for drowning out people who don't realize that waiting rooms are for waiting, not sharing your entire life with everyone around you.  Highly recommend."
2193,"July 10, 2020",5.0,good product,  I like it. That’s what I wanted
2194,"July 10, 2020",5.0,Where have you been all my life?,"  For some time, I thought that AirPods were a silly luxury.  Was I wrong!  Set up was a breeze, sound quality is excellent.  Texting - my least favorite things to do - is so easy with Siri.  Auto correct for manual texting is a pain, but  Siri dictation works beautifully.I am a woman who isn't very technically savvy.  I run a business and often need to multi task. With air pods I can free up my hands , walk both my dogs while answering phone calls and texts, ask Siri to find a news channel, etc, etcI am very happy with this purchase!!"
2195,"July 10, 2020",3.0,Battery doesn't last,"  I have to charge these between meetings because they don't keep a charge.  For this much money, come on!"
2196,"July 10, 2020",1.0,Careful Purchasing,"  We returned a set of defective AirPods. We were just charged for them again, however UPS picked them up from our home almost 2 months ago. We have essentially paid twice for 1 set of AirPods. Not cool. We have made hundreds of purchases, including a $500.00 I watch without issue.Just use caution"
2197,"July 9, 2020",5.0,One of the most innovative products from Apple,  This airpod is the best one I've ever used. Great quality and long-last power. Recommend 200%.
2198,"July 9, 2020",5.0,Hesitant but the real deal!,"  I was a bit hesitant to buy these on Amazon because some people are saying it’s fake or refurbished. But NO, these are the real deal and they’re brand new factory sealed. Totally worth the buy and my boyfriend loves his new AirPods!"
2199,"July 9, 2020",1.0,Too much static whole talking,  Too Much noise and static while talking on phone. Rather buy newer version
2200,"July 9, 2020",5.0,good product,  i got actual apple airpods very nice quality and worked great!
2201,"July 9, 2020",5.0,AMAZING HEADPHONES,"  I recently bought these headphones and they are amazing and the REAL DEAL. These are the Apple generation 2 airpods in a non-wireless case i had the original gen 2's and these ones did the same with the function of ""hey Siri"" and many other things. THESE ARE A GREAT PAIR OF HEADPHONES"
2202,"July 9, 2020",5.0,Love my Airpods,  Love these. I wear them everyday day while walking.

2207,"July 8, 2020",4.0,Excellent,  Best headphones ever.
2208,"July 8, 2020",5.0,Continuous audio the battery doesn't last a hour.,"  People are high this fad saying the battery lasts 6+ hours. True Bluetooth ear bugs last 6+ hours when you DON'T USE THEM,  like for occasional calls. But for continuous music or audio books the battery doesn't last an hour.I forget the things in my ear, that's not a good thing. Noise cancellation? Google ear bud block noise, these don't.I use tether ear buds that cost $10 now. Sorry I bought into this overprice Bluetooth fad."
2209,"July 8, 2020",5.0,5 star definitely ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️,  My first AirPods and work so good!People don’t believe if someone says that are fake!!Thanks a lot!
2210,"July 8, 2020",5.0,I like it,  The AirPods works great and it connects well to my phone. It is not fake. It is a real apple AirPod. Love it
2211,"July 8, 2020",5.0,Great 👍🏾,  My boyfriend loves these air pods ! No complaints
2212,"July 8, 2020",5.0,No ear pain,"  I’m super glad I got these! I got them for two reasons. One, because I listen to podcasts at night and don’t want to disrupt my husband. And I like to go walking with them. The traditional earbuds hurt my ears so I was afraid to get these and they stay in easily and they don’t have hurt my ears at all! I read that some people feel like they will fall out. That doesn’t affect me. I love these!!"
2213,"July 8, 2020",5.0,Thanks apple!!,  These are life changing.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.  Absolutely love them.  When I misplace them I freak out.  I’m so glad I didn’t go with imitations.  These are perfect and work so seamlessly with my apple products.  I feel like I’ve been visited by the Apple gods
2214,"July 8, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Good enough product.. a little overpriced but whatever. Can’t take money with us anyway.

2216,"July 8, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Perfect fit for the ear (note: immediately falls out of the nose).
2217,"July 8, 2020",4.0,Happy Daughter,  These were bought for my daughter so far she loves them. They stay out in her ears when she runs. The shipping box was crushed when it arrived. Good thing the box was 5x larger then the IPod. So far the buds have worked fine.
2218,"July 8, 2020",1.0,Pésimo,  Totalmente decepcionada !!!! El producto vino abierto y regado en la caja aparentemente hasta usados ....

2221,"July 8, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy it,"  This product was terrible. Everything was muffled. All of my friends and family(about 20 people) got this product and all hated it. They wouldn’t stay charged for 15 min, always fell out of my ear. AlsoThe case would not shut all the way. They took very long to connect to my phone. Once it started playing random music instead of the music I wanted. The left right label are also missing"
2222,"July 8, 2020",5.0,Great!!,  My husband loves them !!
2223,"July 8, 2020",5.0,They're great!,  They perfectly came in and I was worried when I saw the other earwax reviews but they are fake those ones with the earwax well it's just those people's earwax so I would really consider buying these totally worth all my money!
2224,"July 8, 2020",5.0,Good price compared to the one they are replacing,"  These were a birthday gift for my daughter, she says they are great."
2225,"July 8, 2020",2.0,don't spend all this money on these,  Very disappointed one stopped working and it's fully charged. 80 dollars to replace this. For the cost noway should they just stop working .

2263,"July 7, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Awesome
2264,"July 6, 2020",1.0,Waste of money,  Only work for a month then the charger was ruin and so was the case which doesn't charge anymore $150 not worth a month
2265,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Great price and great product,  I bought these on sale to replace my mom's old airpods and she's in love! Her old ones would die in 15mins. These are definitely an upgrade! They look exactly like the older gen airpods but the sound quality and battery life are so much better.
2266,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  My first pair of AirPods and I love them. I was worried bc I have small ear holes and usually earbuds hurt me but these don’t
2267,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Great Apple product. Spend the big bucks or don't do it at all.,"  Good sound, they fit in the ears and do NOT fall out like corded buds. The sound is good, but don't expect audiophile level sound. You can't expect any better than this from tiny little ear buds. But the essential element to these are the freedom to walk away from your source with NO wires, nothing. The freedom is the charm here. That and the apple name make this worth the investment. Sometimes I use these, and other times for real music listening I use full size headphones. But for videos, non serious music listening and whatever else, these are great. I would say it's better to spend the extra money and get the good stuff, than spend twenty or thirty bucks on some unknown product. Expensive, but as all else in life you either buy the real deal or you buy some cheap substitutes. Ain't worth it....It paired effortlessly with my iPhone seven and my older iPad four.I recommend genuine apple products."
2268,"July 6, 2020",5.0,A must for Zoom classes,"  I started teaching my yoga classes via zoom out of necessity.  I set up my iPad and everything worked great, except the sound.  I had to speak at full volume for anyone to hear me. It was exhausting. Then another teacher recommended these. I was hesitant to spend so much money hoping for a less costly solution. Finally gave these a try and I’m sorry it took so long.  I can have my head down in a pose demonstrating and talking and can be heard by everyone. Love them! And I use them for listening to music or movies too. Brilliant product"
2269,"July 6, 2020",5.0,LEGIT!,  These are definitely real AirPods. It connects to my phone easily. I was worried that the battery may not last long but so far battery life is good and as advertise.
2270,"July 6, 2020",1.0,"I bought this airpods, received a 10$ stopwatch/timer instead.","  I bought this Airpods in June, when i opened the box there was just a stopwatch that i didn't order and no sign of the airpods."

2274,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Great Headphones,  Great headphones not bad to be Apple the best.
2275,"July 6, 2020",4.0,Legit Apple AirPods. sound good and case works properly.,"  (These are legit Apple AirPods) I was skeptical about getting these AirPods because I was reading some reviews and they were bad. Now that I got them, there are no problems. Some scratches, the sound quality is very sharp, both AirPods and the case charge correctly and they connect to the iPhone properly. These are the 1st gen with no wireless charging case.  I recommend buying."
2276,"July 6, 2020",5.0,clarity,"  I would have liked them to come with the wireless charging case, my fault for not looking. Just to wear around, music and phone calls."
2277,"July 6, 2020",5.0,can I test out a pair,  can I test a pair out
2278,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Authentic AirPods,  Delivery took 5 days. Other that they are real and everything I wanted also came with a charger cord no cube. But that’s fine
2279,"July 6, 2020",1.0,Wow,  Wasn’t loud and mine began to melt
2280,"July 6, 2020",5.0,My son loves these!,"  I haven't used these, as my son purchased them. But I have tried them in my ear. The fit was snug and would not just fall out. The sound was clear. When my son calls me his voice comes across as very clear. When he has them in his ears he cannot hear me so I am assuming the noise cancelling is working just fine lol!"
2281,"July 6, 2020",5.0,I love these!,"  I seriously love these airpods.  I recieved them as a father's day gift and I couldn't be happier.  The sound quality is great and not having any wires is amazing for the work from home experience.  I do wish I could dual pair them with my windows PC, but it's really just apple products that allow that seamless transition.  People on the other end of the call are very impressed with the noise cancellation qualities of the air pods.  Very very happy with this gift and purchase."
2282,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Worth the money!,  I love these airpods. I used it everyday since bought. The battery last very long.
2283,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Absolutely perfect!,"  I debated a long time before purchasing. So glad I got them. Great sound quality, super comfy, don’t fall out of ears (as I feared), charge automatically in case when low. Absolutely love them! You won’t regret buying them!"
2284,"July 6, 2020",5.0,Finally comfortable ear buds,"  Ive been through so many different types of earpods, even Raycons, which were pretty good, but all of them suffered from wear fatigue, I could not wear them for long periods without feeling discomfort, but these I could keep in all day and not notice them.Sound quality is great, Have not had any issues with battery life either.Only small concern is that sometimes the audio cuts in one ear (its very rare and easily fixes itself)The ability to tap an ear to change or stop songs makes it very useful to. I was tempted to get the pros, but I was worried the ear bud issue would be the same as the raycons, but I do look forward to see what Apple does next."

2293,"July 6, 2020",2.0,"Buyer beware, may not be authentic!","  Worked for a few days great and then stopped (amber light kept coming on despite being fully charged, indicating a connection could not be made).  Will return these and buy directly from Apple for a few dollars more to guarantee authenticity."

2295,"July 5, 2020",1.0,Keeps breaking. :/,  I’ve bought these twice already from amazon and both times they’ve broke. I retired the first pair and the seconds just broke and I can no longer return them. Both times the right one stopped playing sound just from sitting and listening to music.

2303,"July 5, 2020",1.0,These work half of the time,"  I am not happy with this product. I am past the return date and frustrated to have spent this type of money on a product that frequently won't connect to my laptop. Also, half of the time, only the left pod works and the right is silent (with both my phone and laptop). Would not recommend."
2304,"July 5, 2020",5.0,BUY THEM,"  The AirPods are dope asf , it’s my first time having them but I love them already I can finally charge my phone and listen to music or whatever at the same time."

2309,"July 5, 2020",5.0,Clear,  Love em
2310,"July 5, 2020",5.0,Super convenient,"  This is the second Airpod I bought. I bought the Airpod 1 before and gave it to my father. After that, I really miss the convenience it can bring to me. So I bought this Airpod 2.  As good as Airpod 1, but to me, I did not feel the difference."
2311,"July 5, 2020",4.0,Return them,"  Amazing sound quality, but they are always falling from ears. It’s really annoying to control them all the time. Unfortunately return it back."
2312,"July 5, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Excellent
2313,"July 5, 2020",5.0,Husband loves them,"  I got these for mothers day but I don't know how they work since they haven't come out of my husbands ears since, which makes me believe they work great! Would recommend for other husbands as they keep him from talking my ear off."
2314,"July 5, 2020",5.0,Nice buy!,  Bought these for my son! He loves them! No regrets!
2315,"July 5, 2020",5.0,Great earphones,"  I've wanted headphones that fit on my ears while I run forever. Every pair I ever bought would fall off my ears. Maybe my ears are just weird, but these work perfect. They sound great too. Another thing I absolutely love about these is that they do not leak sound. I can listen to music as loud as I want at work, and the people one seat over can't hear it over their fan, which is great. Compare that to my last pair of headphones that leaked so much that everyone in my row could hear what I was listening too, and you have yourself a satisfied customer. I bought 3 pairs. One for gym, one for work, one for home."
2316,"July 4, 2020",4.0,Almost perfect,"  Love them, but the battery does not last as long as advertised."
2317,"July 4, 2020",5.0,"Muy buen producto, justo lo que esperaba",  Excelente producto!
2318,"July 4, 2020",5.0,Great Bluetooth connection and battery life,"  One of the best Apple purchases I’ve ever made.The AirPods sound quality is good. Not the best sound quality ever (compared to a pair of Bose headphones), but for its price, I found that the quality was great.The AirPods connect seamlessly and instantly to my iPhone, which was very important to me and made this purchase so great. The battery life is also very impressive. I listen to music and videos with my AirPod for about an hour a day, and I am able to go about four days (if not more) without charging."
2319,"July 4, 2020",5.0,Great sounds,"  Great for the money, but they slip of my ears from time to time"
2320,"July 4, 2020",5.0,Nice birthday present,"  Positive:* Easy to use* Good Quality* Stays charged for long timeNegative:* The charging case is not the best, I had to buy a pouch that I can hook to my belt.* If you press the Air Bods into your ear, it does cancel noise and is louder, but if you just place it in the ear, you get half the quality of sound that you get if you press it in."
2321,"July 4, 2020",5.0,Don’t regret buying,  Bought these for my bf for Christmas 2019 and they have held up great! He uses them constantly and the battery life is absolutely amazing. They get a little dirty in the charging case bc of dust but overall do not regret buying this.
2322,"July 4, 2020",3.0,Question...,"  I love my airpods and have been using them for some time now. I've never had an issue until recently where one airpod never seems to charge in the case despite the case being fully charged. I don't know why this happened all of a sudden this past month. Its incredibly frustrating when I put them in and one seems to have charged perfectly and the other one is at 0%. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Other than that, theyve worked great for the past year."
2323,"July 4, 2020",5.0,No9,  Love it

2327,"July 4, 2020",5.0,Worth the extra money for quality ear phones,"  Have tried all the other type of ear phones available, most sound quality are bad. Pay extra and you will not be disappointed. If you suspect a apple knock off just inform amazon and they will correct problem."

2333,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Work great,"  These work great, second pair I’ve purchased. I’ll make sure not to leave this pair where the dogs can reach them...  I can attest that they are not dog proof."
2334,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Everything is good,  I lost the case. Can I buy just the case thanks
2335,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Great product,"  These things are great. The hey Siri feature makes them much better than the original version. I wasn’t a fan of the AirPods Pro with the supposed noise cancelation as they just created white noise and I felt every bump in the road in my ear drums. So, you get a great product that just works with the base model. Also, I didn’t see the need for wireless charging as the case lasts a long time and only needs charged two or three times a week. (unless you use them for 16hours a day...)"
2336,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,  Awesome! Just what I wanted. I bought an Apple case to go with it. I highly recommend.
2337,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Happy,"  I wish the battery life was longer, but overall they are great. The sound is clear and it allows my hands to be free"
2338,"July 3, 2020",3.0,Not worth the price,  I bought these airpods as a gift for my girlfriend since she wanted to be apart of the hype lol. The sound quality is okay but the noise cancellation is bad. I know they make new ones that cancel noise but at almost double the price. Not worth it in my opinion.
2339,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Worth the money!,"  These are amazing I use them all the time! Iv wanted them for a while but didn’t want to spend the money, these are great though definitely worth the money!!!"
2340,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Great value. Good sound.,  I have owned several pairs of bluetooths earbuds under $200. These Apple AirPods are the best I’ve owned. I jump rope and they stay in place. The sound is excellent. They easily pair with all my Apple devices. This is an authentic Apple product. Recommend highly. Would definitely purchase again.

2343,"July 3, 2020",5.0,These are the best AirPods EVER,  I loved every song bit of it and it has god quality I recommend buying them
2344,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods!,  Love these AirPods! Work so well! Easy to carry around and the life of the battery is long.
2345,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Good sound!,  Love these!
2346,"July 3, 2020",1.0,Just Found Out These Are Not Genuine Apple AirPods,"  I just discovered after having these Airpods for many months that they are not genuine Apple AirPods. The serial number on the box does not match the serial number on the AirPods which does not match the serial number when I open my iphone and go to Settings>General>About and check the serial number. I kept wondering why these didn't quite feel the same in my ear as my first pair that I bought from Apple and later lost. Now I know. These are fake. Because I've had them since Sep 2019, I already know Amazon is going to do nothing."
2347,"July 3, 2020",4.0,LOVE THEM,"  I was debating on buying air pods for a long time now, but I finally caved and did it! I love these! They are so convenient! I can place in my ears and not have to worry about the device they are connected to or the cord. They do not cancel out that much background noise, but i typically only use them to listen to music or for classes on Zoom and for that they are fine. I will say the battery could last a little while longer, I have had to charge them halfway through my 4 hour zoom class even when they had a full charge. But other than that, I love them!!"
2348,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Absolutely wonderful purchase,"  I received my air pods today!  I love they are completely wireless. The pair I previously had weren't. They were very easy to setup and I'm already listening to Pandora. Easy volume changing, too. Siri does it for you! Awesome purchase for me!!"
2349,"July 3, 2020",5.0,One of the best purchases I’ve ever made,  I can’t believe I waited so long to get these! An absolute MUST have if you have an iPhone. I use these during my walks and anytime I’m doing things around the house or running errands.

2356,"July 3, 2020",5.0,AirPod Honest review,  My AirPods came fairly quickly packaged very well. They come with a very nice charging case that has a very long battery life that can last  about three days. Not extremely noise canceling which I think is a Plus.  Overall this product is worth the money I would 100% recommend .
2357,"July 3, 2020",5.0,Can you hear me now?,"  For the price, they’re good. I bought them as a gift and the person really seems to like them. It is an apple product though so how could you not?"

2375,"July 2, 2020",5.0,That charging case is a miracle,  I love my airpods. I was skeptical buying airpods for the price and also I have a hard time with headphones staying in my ears. These are great. The charging case is so clutch
2376,"July 2, 2020",2.0,Issues with Battery Life,"  After 2 months, the right AirPod stopped working even when charged"
2377,"July 2, 2020",5.0,Working out or whatever they never fall out,  Very loud and still when moving
2378,"July 2, 2020",2.0,I may return these,  Does not hold the charge!!!
2379,"July 2, 2020",5.0,Pleased,  Very happy with purchase.
2380,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Price,  Style
2381,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Came in perfect condition,  100% original😻
2382,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Good sound quality and excellent battery life.....,  Amazing! It’s very much comfortable to use and it’s sound quality is excellent. The more feature about it is that it has ear sensing. It automatically stops playing audio when buds are pulled out of ears.
2383,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Perfect
2384,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Great Product,  Good quality
2385,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Love them,  I love the discreteness of these air pods
2386,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Very good!,  Great 👍🏽!!!!
2387,"July 1, 2020",2.0,when on a call you get too much popping noise feedback buzzing,"  this says APPLE, I saw the reviews were great and I used them for a month or so to give it a shot, but the sound quality is bad, not sure if my pair is a dud, but when on a call you can't hear or when you talk it buzzs and gives an inaudible sound, don't wear to talk just listen to music..."
2388,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Highly recommend.,  I can’t believe I waited so long to buy myself a pair of these. Bought them for my 15 yr old and finally splurged on myself. I did not spend the $ on noise cancelling ones as my 31 yr old daughter did and said she did not like them that there was almost a buzzing sound. I highly recommend these.
2389,"July 1, 2020",1.0,SCAM,  I think I’ve been scammed with a fake pair of AirPods.  They don’t hold a charge and I can’t walk more than 2 feet away from any device I’m connected to!!!!
2390,"July 1, 2020",5.0,The best!,"  These were the best gift I’ve gotten, supper easy to get up and I lobe that it reads my text. Great for work when I’m on the phone all day I can still be hands free!"
2391,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Great service,  The product was exactly what I expected and was delivered pretty quickly.
2392,"July 1, 2020",5.0,orignal is orignal,  bought many off brand ear pods but original is the best. love them.
2393,"July 1, 2020",3.0,I wish I could get a refund,  I have had this product since April and now in the left pod their is buzzing. The callers cannot hear me stating I’m going in and out.Think twice before purchasing.
2394,"July 1, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great
2395,"July 1, 2020",5.0,todo perfecto,  si me agrado
2396,"July 1, 2020",5.0,lots of features,"  This was a Father's Day gift for my Husband.  He loves them and says the sound is excellent.  He uses them at work and he is a Foreman for a construction company.  I know that I can hear him better when he uses the airpods on his drive home from work then when he uses the truck hands free microphone paired with his iPhone, that is for sure.We are both very happy with this product."
2397,"July 1, 2020",5.0,THE REAL DEAL,  This apple airpods are awesome with the sound quality and how loud you can put them. What I dislike is if you put it to high the volume people can hear your music.
2398,"July 1, 2020",1.0,"hard to pair, no bass not worth the money compare to the I paid $20. which pair easily sound good.",  Returned but why its taking too long for refund?
2399,"June 30, 2020",5.0,It’s just a good thing get it,  I loved it
2400,"June 30, 2020",4.0,Overall ok but could be better 😢,"  Battery life is pretty good, the case holds more then enough power to keep you going all day. For me personally though the fit for the ears could be a little better maybe include some rubber covers to go over the AirPods and unfortunately there’s really no noise canceling ability as far as I can tell you have to have them 3/4 of the way up to drown out noise from around you"
2401,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Great buy for the value
2402,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Overall I like it tho,  My first pair and I love them I like how u can tap your ear piece and it change the song it’s definitely different from having the regular one I like that I can move around more esp having a special need child and 3 other kids it most definitely comes in handy only thing I don’t like it seems to fall out your ear at times so I would most definitely not use them if I have to use the bathroom wish they could fit tighter into the ear bud
2403,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Best Sound ever!!!!,  My very first AirPods and they are amazing!!! Better than I thought. I had some knock offs and couldn’t use them they hurt my ears so bad. I gave them to my daughter and she didn’t wear them either. These are amazing. Thank you so much!!!
2404,"June 30, 2020",5.0,✨✨✨✨✨,  Never thought of how helpful they can be once you have them!
2405,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Clarity!,"  I’ve heard sounds in songs, beats and effects that I never knew were there. Point is sound quality is wonderful!"
2406,"June 30, 2020",5.0,"Legit, smooth, loud when it matters, and VERY quick responsive.","  Battery life is AMZING! I can control my phone with a lot of things. I can turn up and down the brightness, volume, make calls, etc"
2407,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Nothing else to say,  I love my it and good
2408,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Good product,  My daughter loves them
2409,"June 30, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy these.,  I do not recommend these air pods!  I got one for a gift and got so excited I ordered one for my husband. His one air pod stopped working right away so I returned them. The one I got as a gift gave me a lot of trouble and finally one pod stopped all together so I also had to return.Then I bought the real Apple Air Pods  on Amazon. They cost more but are so much better in every way. Worth the additional expense.
2410,"June 30, 2020",1.0,FAKE!!!!!,  I ordered these as a present for my boyfriend’s birthday and as he opened the box it was empty! the only thing inside the apple box was the apple instruction cards! This was the biggest fail I have ever had so disappointed!!!! DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT AN EMPTY APPLE AIRPODS BOX!!!!!
2411,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Love em,  Good love em
2412,"June 30, 2020",4.0,Good.,"  Pretty good, came in early. Nice headphones"
2413,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Perfect,"  I have been debating getting these for a while, and finally caved in quarantine. I have had these for 2 months now, and STILL have not had to charge them yet. That is unreal. At 75% volume I can't heard a single thing outside of the headphones. These stay put and the sound is great. I keep the on my keys so I can wear them wherever I am. I never have to say, ""wish I had some headphones"", because this way I always do. BUY IT."
2414,"June 30, 2020",2.0,It’s a gamble,"  I Received mines a day ago and it seemed off as soon as I saw both of the AirPods they seem a bit dirty, I just went with it’s nothing until I’ve received a second pair that was purchased for my sister, and you can definitely see that hers are brand new and mines weren’t. Keep in mind both were bought “New”!"
2415,"June 30, 2020",2.0,Dissapointed if Apple Airpods,"  I bought my airpods on Feb. Didn't  use them until March because it was a present for my hubby, well now I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead. I figured, maybe I just need to charge them. So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead.I put them to charge and when I went to retrive them from the case I notice the one with the issue was stuck and felt very hot, it overheated (melted)  and now it's  completed dead. Very dissapointed.I chatted with an Amazon customer service and explained the problem and he was a ble to assist me and said he would send a repacement and exchange the bad ones for some working airpods;He made my day. Thank you Amazon"
2416,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Muy bueno el artículo,  Excelente
2417,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Best sound I’ve ever heard,"  These AirPods are the BEST! I read the reviews before buying them and some people said they got fakes. And/or theirs arrived dirty and used, mine didnt. Not sure if they bought from a Thursday party vendor but if you look carefully before purchasing, the AirPods bought and sold by amazon are LEGIT! The sound is amazing and they stay charged as long as you keep them in the case when you’re not using them. Charge your case regularly like you would your phone if you use these often and you’re good to go!"
2418,"June 30, 2020",5.0,love them,  i bought them twice...1 for me and 1 for my husband and we love them!!
2419,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Love my airpods,  I love my airpods. Ive had them for about a year and use them every day while walking my dogs and listening to podcasts. Battery hasn’t been an issue. I’ve also connected them to my laptop for video meetings. No complaints!
2420,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Great Quailty,  Its worth every penny literally use these everyday .Highly recommend mines came pretty fast a day before the said time .The sound is amazing
2421,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Great product,"  Great product, efficient, battery life could be better but still good"
2422,"June 30, 2020",4.0,Overall it’s good,  I have the noise cancellation a 1 Star only because I thought it cancels out sounds on my end so the other person can’t hear but it actually picks up every thing. However I don’t hear ANYTHING around me other than the person I’m talking to. Overall it’s good quality and I’m happy with my purchase.
2423,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Similar to other apple products.,  They fit my ears just like apple headphones would. The sound quality is great and they last about five hours.
2424,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Sound quality is good
2425,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Good product,  There good for what I use them for but noise cancelation isn't one of the qualitie. Unless you have it super loud so everyone can hear your music
2426,"June 30, 2020",5.0,Awesome quality.,"  Used every single day, not one issue!"
2427,"June 29, 2020",4.0,Perfect! Recommend,"  The only reason I gave it four stars is because its price is not as good as it is on Black Friday. I remember only selling 109 at that time! Of course, the price of amazon is now better than best buy and target!The sound quality is definitely not comparable to beat, but I think it's not bad! Used to answer the phone, watching TV is already very good!"
2428,"June 29, 2020",1.0,Something not right!!!,  This is my second time purchasing these within a year. I’m not very impressed. The left ear pod has lost sound quality. I will take these to Apple to make sure these was not refurbished. I’m very upset I’ve brought two and both had the same issue.
2429,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Box came empty,  Where is my air pods box is empty AirPods box was open when I open box no AirPods
2430,"June 29, 2020",4.0,Cool,  Cool
2431,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Love ‘em,  Perfect
2432,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Real deal,  Everything is great and legit.
2433,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  Granddaughter loves it
2434,"June 29, 2020",3.0,They were geat till they werent,  they just stopped working
2435,"June 29, 2020",5.0,They real.,  The AirPods are real
2436,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Great gadget!,  Awesome gadget!
2437,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Make sure you don’t loose them .😉,  It was nice this is a good thing !
2438,"June 29, 2020",5.0,I really like them,  Doesn’t fit really good in my ears
2439,"June 29, 2020",5.0,So much better than the cheap alternatives,"  Great battery life, good sound quality for listening to TV on the iPad. Wish the pods were easier to get out of the case."
2440,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Conveniently quick delivery,  Summer and fall courses this year are all online for me so I decided I needed something more comfortable to sit through multiple hours of recordings. I am happy to order here instead of Apple website as I received them the following day. Very convenient and comfortable! So glad it arrived so soon rather than 1-2 weeks later.
2441,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Great Product,  This is a really nice deal. I can’t imagine my life without AirPod
2442,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Awesome,"  Awesome on all fronts!  Sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life.  We use these air pods often and we are very happy with it."
2443,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Take a Leap of Faith,"  Bottom line, these are amazing! I had so many other earphones I would interchange depending on what I was doing or which ones had charge but I took a leap of faith and bought these. Now these are the only ones I use! They are so versatile and have really good sound quality!"
2444,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Happy,  It’s everything I expected
2445,"June 29, 2020",5.0,I see now what all the fuss is about,"  I didn't originally want to spend the extra money for airpods, and had some other brand wireless bluetooth headphones. Those worked fine (until they stopped charging for no reason), but the airpods really do work so much better, especially if you have an iphone. Connecting them to the iphone takes seconds, you just hold the case next to your phone and open it. The sound quality is great. The automatic pausing when you take out one airpod is a great feature, and they have a pretty long range - I can leave my phone downstairs and still be connected. The battery life isn't the longest but they charge super quick so it's not a big deal. They're also really comfortable, I have weirdly small ears and I can wear these for hours without any pain or irritation."
2446,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Wonderful Ignore Negative reviews,   Love this in love with my airpods after two years contemplating finally Got them! And they are amazing and beautiful! Original was skeptical with some reviews but just recieved them and they are lovely!

2449,"June 29, 2020",5.0,SHOULD BUY,  I love them they fit my ears perfectly. They are always good during car rides and when you get bored. The sound quality was amazing.
2450,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Love these,"  I love these headphones and wish I had not waited. My wired earbuds kept pulling out of my ears when I took my walk, but these are so convenient, I love the sound quality and being able to skip a song is so great. I highly recommend."
2451,"June 29, 2020",5.0,I loved them,  It’s been a while now since I bought them and they lived to my expectations 😂
2452,"June 29, 2020",3.0,Peace of mind,"  Buying the right brand will give you peace of mind.  However, I see my friend using the same product with different colors, which makes me interesting."
2453,"June 29, 2020",4.0,Wireless headphones,  My mom really like this
2454,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"  Worth for the price , I use it anywhere I go and it doesn’t fall off and the sound quality is amazing"
2455,"June 29, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Cheaper than buying them from Apple.

2464,"June 28, 2020",5.0,Great true wireless earbuds,  Love the convenience and not having to worry about yanking these out of my ear at the gym due to the wires.
2465,"June 28, 2020",5.0,Really recommended,  Everything was great!
2466,"June 28, 2020",4.0,A must have,  Bought this for my son he absolutely love them always in his ear
2467,"June 28, 2020",5.0,Great product and costumer service,"  I bought this for a gift but they came used, so I talked to costumer service and they made a return and asked me to buy another ones paying me the fastest shipping. The last ones came perfect and they sound pretty good."
2468,"June 28, 2020",4.0,Good soh und,  Would fit better with rubber tips
2469,"June 28, 2020",5.0,Amazing Service,  Shipping came the day before I was expecting. Packaging and product was brand new and very presentable. Most definitely will shop with you again!
2470,"June 28, 2020",5.0,Awesome AirPods,  I love these AirPods.  They are so comfortable and convenient and the sound quality is excellent.  I love how they automatically turn in when you put them in your ears.  The battery life is really good.  Have never even come close to running out of battery life even after several hours of use.
2471,"June 28, 2020",5.0,Happy Client,  Sooo in love these are perfect for work and to workout.  I go biking a lot and they stay on
2472,"June 28, 2020",4.0,Easy to use,"  Very easy to connect and use. Also easy to lose, but thats probably just me!"
2473,"June 28, 2020",1.0,AirPod quality is so bad,"  This is my second AirPod and I had it for a month only used it a few times when I went out, which was like 2-3 times since we are in quarantine. However, today the left side did not work at all. It completely shut off no sound. The right side works fine. The last set of AirPod I had also had the same problem. I’m so disappointed that I wasted money on yet, again another brand new but broken AirPod."
2474,"June 27, 2020",5.0,They are real,"  The airpods work really well and when I had them within a week I dropped them in milk by accident good thing it had a case, it still got wet but they worked just fine. They are real"
2475,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Apple airpod,  Very nice
2476,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Brand new!!! Great quality🤩
2477,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Muy bueno,  Muy bueno
2478,"June 27, 2020",1.0,Would not pair,  Would not pair with cell phone.
2479,"June 27, 2020",5.0,fits amazingly!,"  I really like EarPods even more than AirPods pro, fits way better!"
2480,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Just what I thought ❤️,  I love it
2481,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Now i can watch pornhub
2482,"June 27, 2020",5.0,These are so helpful.,"  I love being able to listen to music without cords. They never fall out, and I got them for a great price. My friends almost convinced me to spend $100 more to get the new pros for better noise cancellation, but these block out all the sound and I can hear more levels of my favorite songs that I never knew existed. Love these and the battery life is AWESOME."
2483,"June 27, 2020",5.0,LOVE THEM!!,"  To start off, these are 100% GENUINE. I confirmed the serial number on the Apple website. I even purchased a second pair a few weeks later and THOSE were legitimate too. I have no idea what to say about reviews claiming these are fake. If you buy these and get ones you believe are fake.....it’s a good thing Amazon has an awesome return policy! :DI love these sooo much!! When airpods first came out, I thought they were the most useless luxury and never saw myself buying them. It wasn’t until recently I became interested in airpods when normal wired earbuds were becoming extremely annoying during workouts. I decided to make the plunge and don’t regret it one bit.These are  sooo freeing and enjoyable to wear. Super convenient for working out and I can even walk all over the house without my phone and still be able to listen to things!I even bought a pair for my dad and he loves wearing them when working in the garden. He was never too bothered by wires but agrees that airpods are so nice because of how “freeing” they are.Because of the freedom airpods allot we find ourselves listening to way more music/videos/podcasts which is great for managing stress too.A+!!"
2484,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Best,"  After trying all different brands, if you are in the Apple ecosystem this is the best choice."
2485,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Great !,"  Apple Quality Product, works like a charm !"
2486,"June 27, 2020",5.0,awesome,  love my air pods
2487,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Great price,  No issues next day shipping and cheaper then other stores
2488,"June 27, 2020",5.0,As promised,  As promised
2489,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Great,  I bought these as “like new” and they work great. They are 100% real AirPods. If your ever not sure there is a website where you can run the serial number through it and it I’ll tell you if it’s an official apple product!
2490,"June 27, 2020",2.0,doesn’t work half the time,  the left airpod doesn’t work half the time. i take it out of the case and i doesn’t play any music. i have to put them both back into the case and take them back out for it to work
2491,"June 27, 2020",5.0,I've liked these more than I expected,"  Didn't think I'd like these as much as I do, but they make quarantine conference calls so much more tolerable. I especially like being able to charge one side while continuing to use the other.  They also charge super fast.I'm on the phone all dang day and this is key."
2492,"June 27, 2020",4.0,Wireless freedom!,"  Much better than wired earbuds. Easy to sync. Sometimes the phone gets confused on using airpods or Bluetooth in the car for sound... I have to manually switch sounds to iPhone then back to airpods to “unconfuse” the phone.Noise cancellation tends to amplify my background noise on the caller’s end, sometimes drowning me out."
2493,"June 27, 2020",5.0,AirPods ❤️,  This product is amazing. I’ve had mine for a little over a year now and still working perfectly.
2494,"June 27, 2020",5.0,Perfect!!,  Awesome!!
2495,"June 26, 2020",4.0,My wired earphones are louder than them though,  Love the wireless earphones they charge fast
2496,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Perfect condition,  Airpods were in perfect condition and sound amazing.
2497,"June 26, 2020",2.0,Dirty and broken AirPods,  AirPods came with earwax. Right AirPod was significantly lower than the right one.
2498,"June 26, 2020",4.0,muy buen producto vale la pena la inversión,"  me agradaron y me justaron mucho, cómodos y recomendables al 100%"
2499,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Leave the airpod in its compartment before you connect it,  Everything very easy to assemble
2500,"June 26, 2020",1.0,Eh,  Got a pair that wont connect..

2503,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Awesome !!,"  love this product! great headphones, great sound and comfortable!"
2504,"June 26, 2020",3.0,Great sound quality but poor design,"  Initially I was given in to the hype of these as the pros a bit more expensive. After a few days I can honestly say that the quality is superb the bass is great, the noise canceling probably non existent. Design could be a bit better as those with small ears causes pain. I wish the made tips for these or maybe it’s just me. Over great product will definitely buy a second pair for my wife."
2505,"June 26, 2020",5.0,I can’t do without them now.,  I love these things! Easy to operate.
2506,"June 26, 2020",1.0,Very poor quality,  I’ve only owned these for about 2 months. Only one AirPod will work at a time. Either the right or the left but not both at the same time. I’ve reset them maybe 20 times as instructed. No difference very disappointed.
2507,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Great,  I love to have my hands free!
2508,"June 26, 2020",5.0,great Bluetooth earbuds,  I was worried that these would be fake but to my delight they work great!!
2509,"June 26, 2020",1.0,One headphone stopped working after less than 3 months of use.,  DO NOT buy this product. My right earbud will no longer charge. Waste of money.
2510,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Very good quality,  Best airpods by apple
2511,"June 26, 2020",3.0,Air pods,  The right air pod doesn’t work.
2512,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Review overall,  This product is amazing. Really is the best choice amazon could have offered. I love them.
2513,"June 26, 2020",5.0,Excellent Sound!,  Noise cancelation works very well considering the size of the AirPods and the sound quality is excellent.  Battery life is 4-5 hours of usage.
2514,"June 26, 2020",4.0,Life of charge,  Will not stay charged very long!
2515,"June 26, 2020",4.0,Good sound but poor battery life,  Ive had the generic version and just recently got these. Sound quality is great but the battery life is short compared to the cheaper ones i had
2516,"June 26, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy,  I wore these and it rained one time and now my right ear piece won’t let me talk through it to anyone. Right ear piece works but the left does not. Was working great until it rained. For the money its not worth buying these. If it can’t take a little rain then there’s better out there
2517,"June 26, 2020",5.0,He loves them!!!,  I bought my son a pair of these for his 14th birthday and omg absolutely loves them!!! They seem to be able to do so many cool things!! They also arrived very quickly and I was very happy about that!!
2518,"June 25, 2020",5.0,A new necessity,"  Battery lasts forever, great range, charges super fast, and didn’t break when it rained. Heck yeah."
2519,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  I have wasted so much money on earbuds trying to avoid paying this kind of money for Apple Airpods. Should have just bought these in the first place.
2520,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Best product,  Great buy for product
2521,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Poor battery life,"  Battery only last about 3 hrs, glad I got ear bud leash cause they do fall out"
2522,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Apple original,  great apple product no complaints
2523,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Overall Amazing product,  These products are very nice the packaging was amazing and the quality overall was very good  tho sometimes the music from the AirPods become faded out and in but that could be a technicality difficultly with my phone and when volume is up high the noise cancellation is awesome and I went a whole 2 day with neither my Case or AirPods dying overall amazing product
2524,"June 25, 2020",5.0,is very good,  nothing love it
2525,"June 25, 2020",5.0,GET THEM,"  BROOOOO THESES are the best, they are just like from apple but just cheaper, I love them😍😍😍"
2526,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Fantastic!,  These are awesome.  Definitely worth the price.
2527,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Amazing
2528,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Seamless integration with iPhone is worth the price.,"  The seamless experience with these and an iPhone just makes life so much easier. Finally took the plunge and got a used pair from here. Well worth it, sound is surprisingly better than the wired earpods and louder than the stock earpods as well. Only suggest getting these if you are using them with an apple device. If you use an android, check out the pixel buds or Samsung buds. Whichever of those that let's you enjoy the seamless experience like these are to the iPhone or apple device."
2529,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  They came quicker than expected! Great mother’s day gift.
2530,"June 25, 2020",5.0,These are awesome!,  Life saver
2531,"June 25, 2020",4.0,Would recommend,  Comfortable
2532,"June 25, 2020",4.0,Uneven battery life,"  These are my first airpods and they are quite convenient, and work well. My only gripe is that my right airpod consistently has less battery life than the left.I take them both out at the same time or I take the left one out first, so they have the same charge and use time. If the left is at 85%, the right will be around 75-80%. When the right airpod gives the warning low battery tone at 10%, the left will still be fine with 22% left. I've had them for a month and this battery life discrepancy has been consistent."
2533,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Thanks,  Thanks
2534,"June 25, 2020",5.0,These are awesome!,"  I bought the Gen 2 AirPods and they are fantastic! they were easy to setup, work seamlessly on all devices and i've had no issues whatsoever. They are well worth the money, don't hesitate on buying these for a second. There is no active noise cancellation - that is only for AirPods Pro so make sure you know what you're buying!"
2535,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Great Sound,"  Once set up, the AirPods are easy to use, have a good long battery life and provide very good quality sound."
2536,"June 25, 2020",5.0,:),  :)
2537,"June 25, 2020",3.0,"Like most Apple products, they work well until they don't","  Disclaimer: I didn't want to get these. I would prefer to use wired earbuds.  But with the removal of the 3mm headphone jack in all iPhones, I can no longer simultaneously charge the phone and use the earbuds which is a huge problem.So I tried these, which work pretty well most of the time.  Audio quality is just ok - I am frequently having people on the line say ""what?"" because they can't hear me any time there is ambient background noise. A bigger annoyance is about 10% of the time when I answer the phone, the airpods just don't work - they don't pick up the call, but block the call from working on speaker or phone either, so both parties sit there saying ""hello?"" ""hello?"" ""hello?"" until somebody hangs up and tries again.I'd rather just have my headphone jack back,"
2538,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Excellent Earbuds,"  These are wonderful earbuds!  Very comfortable, which makes them perfect when WFH. Sound quality and battery are excellent."
2539,"June 25, 2020",5.0,AirPods A+,  These AirPods are amazing. Going cordless is the way to go and I forget I’m even wearing them when I’m working. They stay in and work perfectly for what I need.
2540,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Ear buds,  Great quality..was worth the higher price. Would highly reccomend!
2541,"June 25, 2020",1.0,It’s scam,"  Broken/damage , very bad condition"
2542,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Awesome Wireless Headphones,"  I have been wanting a good pair of wireless earphones for a while now, but have resisted buying one due to issues related to connectivity, falling off from the ear, etc. But these pair of earphones have been amazing, they do not fall off, the connectivity is reliable and stable, the voice clarity is awesome. These are not noise cancelling so just be aware of this if you are looking for a pair of noise canceling earphones."
2543,"June 25, 2020",4.0,Just Okay...,"  I hate that the sound quality is bad.  I think that I sound clear when others state that I sound muffled or they cannot understand me at all.  I also hear crackling sounds every once in a while.  Other than that, they are good.  The battery life is amazing and they are quite handy when you want to talk on the phone but it needs to charge."
2544,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Excellent sound quality.,  Excellent sound quality. Didn’t get this before because for me it was a lot of money for headphones. But now I get it.
2545,"June 25, 2020",1.0,Doesn’t work .,  at first they were ok now they disconnect reconnect break up one works then both works making my phone slow there terrible. One star because they look nice but it’s a no for me.
2546,"June 25, 2020",1.0,Empty box!!!,  Waited 10 days for these air buds and received an empty box. Got a refund and purchased at Best Buy . Got them the same day!!!
2547,"June 25, 2020",5.0,"Much better than the stock, wired buds","  The air pods have quite a bit of battery life; enough for nearly a full day of music listening. The sound quality is quite impressive. Especially compared to the stock buds. While these don't seem to have ambient noise cancelation for the wearer, they do have impressive noise cancelation when on phone calls. My kids were in the middle of small riotous wrestling match while I was attempting to participate in a call. I apologized about the noise and was told they couldn't really hear anything other than my voice. I clarified they couldn't hear the shrieking and was told no. Impressive."
2548,"June 25, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Original
2549,"June 25, 2020",4.0,Battery life,  How long it’s the battery supposed to last????
2550,"June 25, 2020",4.0,Apple AirPods.,  Very good sound quality.  Sound quality is superior to most other earphones on the market.  Drawback...they don't fit in the ears all that well.  The AirPods work seamlessly with one's Apple devices -a big plus.
2551,"June 24, 2020",5.0,AIRPODS!!!!!,  There good
2552,"June 24, 2020",1.0,Stopped working after 4 months!!,  One of the AirPods doesn’t connect to the devices anymore just after 4 months. Only one side works now. Very disappointed at the quality.
2553,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Worth it,  Love them! Apple makes really great earbuds and these live up to that expectation. I love them and they set up in seconds
2554,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Apple products generally have great quality.
2555,"June 24, 2020",3.0,"Everything is fine, but my ears are too big","  Well, everything is fine, the sound is good, design is fashionable,the price is reasonable,battery life is long enough. But I don’t know why they fall out of my ears every couple 20mins, maybe my ears are too big,so I can’t wear them outdoors . I gave it to my little brother, he loves it though"
2556,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Makes life easier,"  Here’s the truth. It’s not perfect. Sometimes it’s hard to connect to your phone. Also, it’s hard to find when you put it down somewhere for a bit then go do something else. I’ve also had times when the song was playing on my phone and the AirPods were connected yet I could not hear a single sound. But you’ll love it - especially when you’re exercising or doing outdoor activities. It’s also better quality the wired earphones. The battery life is not bad too."
2557,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Love the sound quality,"  They are great, but they kinda hurt my ears when I put them in. I have small ears."
2558,"June 24, 2020",1.0,No,  No

2561,"June 24, 2020",1.0,"$140 expense, 4 week guarantee","  My airpods quit working after 6 weeks of use.  After 88 weeks, I learn that the return window was four weeks. Ripoff."
2562,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Don’t where them all the time also to bed,  Hella good
2563,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Work great,  Got these for my husband for father's day he loves them! On the other hand I was disappointed that they delivered them to my neighbors porch! Thank goodness he is a cool neighbor!

2566,"June 24, 2020",5.0,Worth the price!,  Battery life lasts long and they charge fully in less that 10 minutes !
2567,"June 24, 2020",4.0,Works really well with my iPhone,  K’NEX very easily with my iPhone. I only complaint is that earbuds seem to be a little loose in your ear although they’ve never fallen out. Sound quality is very good.
2568,"June 24, 2020",1.0,Horrible,  Horrible electricity shock!
2569,"June 24, 2020",1.0,Poorly put together,  Fell apart first time taken out of case

2583,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
2584,"June 23, 2020",5.0,These changed my life!!,"  I LOVE my AirPods. I use them all the time. I’ll usually clip them to my belt or bag (I bought a separate case) and carry them everywhere. I never feel like they’re going to fall out of my ears. I’ve done yard work, and gone running with them in and never had an issue. The only thing is the mic isn’t the BEST. I’m a singer and if I need my headphones to use my vocal app, it doesn’t always pick up the first part of a phrase and can pick up background noise. However, I’m still rather in love with the headphones. Highly recommend to anyone who will not lose them!"
2585,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Awesome,"  The product was perfect, easy to connect and the sound is very clear."

2589,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
2590,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Worth The Money,"  I’ve had these AirPods for a couple of weeks now and so far they’re  definitely worth the money. They arrived brand new in the box and were extremely easy to pair with my phone. The battery quality is so much better than I thought it’d be. I charge the case once and it’ll last me the whole day. The only negatives is the sound canceling is not the greatest. Also, for everyday tasks the headphones stay in very well however when I go to workout I have trouble with the AirPods staying in my ear. However I would still recommend."
2591,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Great product,  The best AirPods!
2592,"June 23, 2020",5.0,It’s Apple,  It’s Apple. What’s not to like?

Work really well with all my apple products, clean sound, out of all the apple products I own these are NOT overhyped, once you buy them and start using them you will understand.  I have talked my friends into purchasing them and everyone loves them."

I'm not sure why and I've tried cleaning it again. Honestly, there are a lot of good off-brand products on Amazon that pair just as easily. If I could go back I'm not sure I would spend the money on these."

2603,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Came with a charger & all . Works perfectly fine like Apple AirPods ! Won’t regret purchasing .
2604,"June 23, 2020",5.0,"Great purchase, worth the money","  The AirPods are great. I like to listen to music with a lot of bass so the AirPods support that. Only issue is that you can't use them when you go for a run. I bought these ear hooks to use when I go for a run. It was only 3 dollars. So overall, not a bad purchase"
2605,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Good so far,"  Just received , All seem great , shows up on apple site"
2606,"June 23, 2020",4.0,Noise cancellation.,  Disappointed there is no noise cancellation.

2609,"June 23, 2020",5.0,I love them!!!,  The people with negative reviews couldn’t have bought these particular AirPods lol. I’m in love with everything about them. They came packaged perfectly and I was able to verify the serial number. Setup was nonexistent - I literally opened them and they connected to my iPhone (and they came fully charged). I haven’t charged the case in days and my AirPods and case have yet to die. SO glad I made this purchase!
2610,"June 23, 2020",3.0,Used product arrived VERY dirty,  Wish I had thought to take pictures but these air pods arrived filthy. There was dirt and earwax on the ear pieces and dirt and deep scratches on the case. I was shocked that these were deemed acceptable to be returned by the first purchaser and sold as is. Beware if you decide to purchase used or refurbished.
2611,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Great product,  These are REAL AirPods if anyone was wondering and they work great love the sound quality and they don’t fall out of your ears

2614,"June 23, 2020",1.0,BEWARE:  Lasted Only 6 Months,"  These AirPods were rarely used and still only lasted 6 months.  They were a Christmas gift for my daughter and have been a constant problem.  One side won't work, then the other, etc.  We followed all of the instructions in Apple Support, but now they are completely inoperable.  Cannot recommend them and Apple is next to impossible to deal with.  STILL trying to either get a refund or get them replaced."

2618,"June 23, 2020",2.0,It's not working well with my Android not charging like it should and won't hold a charge,  I have an Android I read the reviews and it said it was still work on the Android but it does not keep battery life at all and it doesn't connect back as well as it should my other products normally would.it bad to stay charged for 4 hours and I know it should stay charged way longer than that and I'm not even using it at work the battery life is no good or something is wrong with the charging station.
2619,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Life changing!,  This is going to be a game changer for my husband. He is very busy with his hands all day and these AirPods are going to make his life so much easier. He will be able to talk to customers and not have to worry about holding his phone and can still be working with his hands.
2620,"June 23, 2020",5.0,Good deal,  I also love a good deal! Love these good quality!
2621,"June 22, 2020",5.0,Great purchase,  Work great! I bought these in March and have used them everyday since then. The sound quality is amazing and the battery normally lasts for a couple days before I have to charge them again. Would definitely recommend.

2651,"June 21, 2020",5.0,They are real,   These are very much so real and they fit perfect and sound perfect because me personally I like it when my music is blasting in my ears and I will say these are pretty good at blasting music they get loud but not unnecessarily loud and the base on them is pretty girlie and if you have them blasting music you can’t hear people at all so all around good product 👍🏾
2652,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Best thing and it’s Worth it,  I like everything ab it thax💜💜💜
2653,"June 21, 2020",5.0,NOT A SCAM!!!,  My other AirPods broke so I needed these. Great quality.
2654,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Excellent air pods,  The Apple airpods are so easy to charge and use. We have multiple iphones at home and never had issues in connecting it to wrong phone.
2655,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Good,  Too expensive
2656,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Good
2657,"June 21, 2020",5.0,BRAND NEW,  PEFRECT FRESH OUT THE BOX
2658,"June 21, 2020",1.0,They do not stay in my ears,  I would like to return the AirPods because they won't stay in my ears.
2659,"June 21, 2020",1.0,Don’t do it go to a store,  I only received the charger.
2660,"June 21, 2020",3.0,Do not recommend. Spend a little extra and get the Airpods Pro,  Waste of money - go for the improved design! They kept falling out of my ears during workout so I ended up having to buy the Airpods Pro. I was a day late for the return deadline or would have sent back.
2661,"June 21, 2020",1.0,Buy from apple.com,  Left earth piece.was blown.  I think they were preowned
2662,"June 21, 2020",5.0,If they’re thinking about buying these headphones? DO IT,"  I was very skeptical ordering these since I read a ton of bad reviews.  But honestly?  I really love these.  They are authentic Apple AirPods and I’m very please with them.  They were super simple to set up (I have an iPhone XR) and all around I’m just happy with my purchase.  Don’t believe what everyone else is saying, as long as you buy new, you’ll be just fine!  These are 2nd gen.  AirPods.  I have the wired charging case since I didn’t see the point in spending 60 extra dollars to get the wireless.  So far they’ve held a charge extremely well.  I was always on the edge when it came to buying these, I’ve kinda always wanted them, but never bought them.  Now I’m SO glad I did.  To anyone who is debating buying these but isn’t sure?  DO IT you won’t regret it!"
2663,"June 21, 2020",5.0,This is so fun to use,  Good product
2664,"June 21, 2020",5.0,They charge really fast,  They are awesome
2665,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Great Quality,  Love these AirPods!
2666,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Awesome product!!!,"  Once I started using them, I just couldn’t imagine a life without them."

2669,"June 21, 2020",5.0,Price unexpected,  I’m so proud with my AirPods
2670,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Get these,  These are great.  Can’t believe it took me as long as it did to get a pair.
2671,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Simple to use and battery and sound is great,  The absolute best purchase I have ever made !  I love these ! I bought others that were less expensive and one pair never worked ! These are so easy to use !  I highly recommend these .
2672,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Great,  Music
2673,"June 20, 2020",5.0,"Worth every penny, should have gotten sooner","  I waited for these to go on sale, but man I wish I had bought them earlier, even if it meant paying a little more. I don't know how I lived without these for so long. I've spent $60+ on off-brand wireless headphones because I did not want to pay for Airpods. Well, joke was on me, because those headphones were all awful and these are amazing!! Battery life isn't great, and they are not noise cancelling, but I love them in general."
2674,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Bought this since I’m sick of wires haha,  Fast and easy connection. Good sound.
2675,"June 20, 2020",1.0,love the box😍😍😍,  receieved absolutely nothing but an empty box. at least the charger is there.
2676,"June 20, 2020",5.0,REAL,  there’s really good:) works well
2677,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Everything you expect,  Everything I expected it to be. Just like if I bought them from Best Buy or Walmart! 👍 or straight from Apple lol.
2678,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Recieved exactly what i paid for,  Brand new airpods that work and sound great and charge very fast. Very well worth the money
2679,"June 20, 2020",5.0,.,  Works well. The battery life is good and the sound quality and great.
2680,"June 20, 2020",5.0,they came they knew quickly I recommend it,  they came they knew quickly I recommend it
2681,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Great product,  These were for my daughter's birthday!  They work great.
2682,"June 20, 2020",1.0,Never came,  Hi I ordered a pair of AirPods on the 19th and I got my package today and they were not in the box and was wondering what happened to my order. These were supposed to be a birthday gift and for me to spend all this money for there to be nothing deeply concerns me how
2683,"June 20, 2020",1.0,They are junk,  The first pair didnt work so they got sent back and the second pair only worked 3 months and broke now im stuck dealing with apple costumer service to try to fix them worst purchase ive made from amazon
2684,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Same as above.,  My granddaughter loves them.
2685,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
2686,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Highly recommended...
2687,"June 20, 2020",5.0,"Super convenient, sounds is fine.","  I tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds before these (they had good reviews and were cheaper), but they didn’t fit my ears well, they pressed on the cartilage in my ears and the sound was not at good. So I got these and I ave been SUPER happy. They fit just like the ear buds that come with iPhones (so not perfect, but they are comfortable for smaller ears). I use one at a time while listening to podcasts, books, or talking on them to make the battery last longer."
2688,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Great Father's Day Gift,"  These little earbuds are something my husband has been wanting for quite awhile. I'm excited to give them to him tomorrow, on Father's Day. They are small enough to carry on plane trips without adding much weight and without dealing with extra cords in the confinement of an economy seat. Great convenience. Delivery was prompt."
2689,"June 20, 2020",4.0,Easy to connect to apple devices with great sound but can be uncomfortable for long use!,"  Quick and easy to connect to different apple devices (I use them with my IPad Pro and IPhone” take a LOT of getting used to ear comfort wise. I never thought it was possible to have sore ears but it is!! The sound quality, them being wireless, and quick connection make it worth it though."
2690,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Excellent Product.,  New as listed. Great product. Comfortable fit.
2691,"June 20, 2020",1.0,That the left one is very low,  One headphones is destroyed
2692,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Not sure how I lived without these before!,  Batteries last awhile and charge so quick. Case rarely needs charges.
2693,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Very good,  Bought these a few months back and they're still just as good as when I bought them. Definitely recommend
2694,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Wonderful,  The best
2695,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Love it
2696,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Good,  It is not bad . I used it very well it is ok .
2697,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  Hesitated to buy forever and so glad I did. Use them daily for work from home.  I’m on the phone a ton and love these for that purpose. Previously I had purchased cheap imitations. Hated them. Finally bought these and let my kids play with the others.  Yet again another great Apple product worth the money.
2698,"June 20, 2020",3.0,Fantastic . . . while they lasted,"  used this product for a little less than two weeks to do yard work around the house and they were great at the time. This was until the main speakers in the right ear stopped working, had to return for a new product"
2699,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Excellent Quality!,"  I bought two of these one for my mom and one for me. They are great for on the go use. The quality is also spectacular, considering I left one of the air pods in my hoodie while it was in the wash and drier. It still works by the way."
2700,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Husband uses these ALL day,"  My husband loves these.  He listens to podcasts all day long, so they are very helpful to not have the cord hanging down!"
2701,"June 20, 2020",5.0,Altamente recomendado!,"  Recién compré los Apple AirPods y estoy encantado con ellos, suenan muy bien por un muy buen precio, son altamente recomendados."
2702,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Amazing shipping,  Love it and fast shipping
2703,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great sound quality. No noise cancellation. Light and practical.,  Is it clear the the AirPods are and will be the best ever. These AirPods are have a beautiful and clean design that not only makes you appreciate what you have but you want to take care of them every time you see them. The sound quality is great however it does not have noise cancellation. They are super practical and l get to carry around and they connect as soon as you open the AirPods case.
2704,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Comfortable and perfect fit.,"  I'm so happy with the product! Overall 5 stars. I was hesitant to buy them because I read some issues on the Apple forums but I don't experience any of them. Comfortable and they fit perfectly. Technology-wise, Apple's quality is always the same for me. Great deal to buy it from Amazon."
2705,"June 19, 2020",5.0,AirPods,"  great item, quick shipment"
2706,"June 19, 2020",4.0,Great Product!,  They are very convenient especially when I’m walking around or doing other activities and I don’t have to constantly hold my phone which is perfect the only thing is it after a while they do tend to hurt the inside of my ears but I can tolerate it and I’ll just take them out for a little while the battery life on them is that they don’t last all day but for the majority of the time the best thing about it is that once they start to go dead I can pop them in the case and they’re charged within a matter of minutes normally what I would do is use one and when that one dies I can switch them out! Pricey but worth it
2707,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Love the air pods but hate the battery life is not longer. You only get about 2 1/2 hours out of them. But over all I would recommend them!
2708,"June 19, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Great earbuds...
2709,"June 19, 2020",4.0,Great sound. Easy to use. Not enough features,"  These are great. Simple to use. Easy to pair. But definitely lack in the features section. They rely very heavily on Siri rather than taps to the device. I would love to adjust volume without asking Siri... just seems weird to ask for the volume to go down, especially if you’re not in a private setting."
2710,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great quality!,  Definitely worth the money to get the originals! My son bought these with his allowance money and I wasn’t mad. They have so many awesome crayon them. He’s 11 and takes really good care of his stuff so these were a great purchase for him!
2711,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Love,  💕
2712,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Like any others,"  I didn’t  have any problem with them, they worked well."
2713,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great investment,  I hate holding my phone to my ear and this was a great investment
2714,"June 19, 2020",4.0,It's an Apple product,"  What can I say... I phoned Apple support and they thanked me for my ""ongoing support of Apple and their products"". Holy crap, I was informed that over the years, my family had 26 Apple devices.  Countless iphones, ipads, laptops, desktops, ipods, earpods, appletv...  Yes, I drank the Koolaid, but hell, the laptops/computers didn't get infections and if I ever had a problem they fixed it.  So why 4's instead of 5's on earpods....well, I enjoy more bass and I want the things to be more comfortable to wear so sue me."
2715,"June 19, 2020",5.0,The wife loved it,  My wife loved the mothers day gift. Nice quality sound
2716,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great investment!,  For the price I wish you could be able to change the volume settings on the actual pods but other than that they are great!
2717,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great Gift!!,  I got this as a gift for my sister's birthday and she loves them!
2718,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Great airpods,  Just what I expected! Haven’t have a probably with them yet! I would definitely recommend theses
2719,"June 19, 2020",1.0,Too much expensive,  Its not to expectations..
2720,"June 19, 2020",1.0,don't get airpods,  like 2 months later only the left one was working
2721,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,  I’ve had them for maybe 2 weeks now and I’ve only charged them once & they haven’t died! Sound quality is good and no problems here.
2722,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Nice fit,  Fits nicely. Great battery life. Sound quality is Great weather using in one ear or both ears.
2723,"June 19, 2020",1.0,Non functional,  HORRIBLE! Couldn’t even connect it ONCE! CLUNKY and awkward and couldn’t fit the earbud in my ear. Not sure if they test these products!
2724,"June 19, 2020",5.0,My first airpods,  Got these for birthday gift and I love them
2725,"June 19, 2020",3.0,Okay,"  These started out great but the past few weeks, the left is louder then the right pod. They have been cutting in and out during songs and it is getting annoying."
2726,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Perfect,"  I have always had some sort of wireless headphones from other big brands and I liked them but I like these so much more. They’re the normal earbud shape which always felt comfortable in my ear and they have the same sound and everything as the wired ear buds. I love these so much, I didn’t think I would use them as much as I do but I use them literally every day."
2727,"June 19, 2020",5.0,Some of the best headphones out there,  Comfortable to wear. Love the touch options
2728,"June 19, 2020",1.0,Bad Fit,  Hi bad fit and will not stay JLAS or Samsung fit and work better and battery life is better
2729,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Awesome 😍,"  Delivery was fast & on time , BRAND NEW ! absolutely love it very loud & it’s the REAL product"
2730,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Great Product,  Excellent
2731,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Best purchase ever! Loving my airpods.,  I regret not getting this a lot sooner. I’m an apple user and always wanted to get an airpods but they are pretty expensive. I got this with $20 discount and it is amazing. I don’t have to keep holding my phone on my ears to talk. I like that you can pause/play and previous/next track on it by just double tapping it. This is a MUST if you are an apple user and like to listen to music.
2732,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Never falls,  Sound and working with phone is excellent. Battery life is a little bit shorter than my previous earbuds
2733,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Great product!
2734,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  They came on time and they last a long time and they charge fast. They are so easy to set up and use. Definitely a great purchase.
2735,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Great gift!,  A great gift for a friend who is a new Mother and now her hands are tied up holding the phone.

2737,"June 18, 2020",4.0,Review AirPods,  Sound quality is great
2738,"June 18, 2020",5.0,"Was skeptical at first , but so far so good :)","  Disclaimer : this is going off the first few day of purchase, i’ll update this later for my final thoughts. They came in still wrapped and appear to be new. I was skeptical about these being real , but so far it’s going good. The serial number check wasn’t working for me , but i’m able to track them with find my iphone, and all other features compared to the real ones check out. They connected quick and easily, plus the sound is really clear. They fit in my ears nicely, i havent had trouble with them falling out thus far. Mine came with the standard apple charging cord."
2739,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Love them,"  Bought them as a fathers day gift. Great product, exactly what I wanted for my husband."
2740,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Excellent Quality,"  I am really enjoying these AirPods! I am hearing instruments that I never heard before in some of my favorite songs, and enjoying music on a whole new level."
2741,"June 18, 2020",5.0,genuine Apple airpods...,"  I lost my Apple airpods and tried to replace them with a generic knockoff, big mistake couldn't even get them to charge. Read the review for this and ordered, despite some unfavorable reviews. Arrived quickly and right out of the box they connected to my phone, obviously new since they were not already named. Looked exactly like my lost pair. I got new airpods without having to pay full price. Very happy with this purchase."
2742,"June 18, 2020",2.0,One of my AirPods Stopped working,  One of my AirPods Stopped working
2743,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Great and they stay in my ear unlike the pro.,  They are great for my need!!
2744,"June 18, 2020",1.0,Check before sending,  There are no airpods inside the box. It cam empty.
2745,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Mother’s Day gift,  Great product! Wife loves them!Definitely buy again!
2746,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Quality and product expectations,  Pretty good Airpods and it's a quality item. I will recommend.
2747,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Better Sound Experience,"  These are worth the money, work great and basically give you a better experience than any other similar item by anyone else."
2748,"June 18, 2020",1.0,Not apple product,"  I ordered these airpods believing they were what they advertised to be which were ""Apple Airpods"".  They were in fact counterfeit or imitation airpods.  Purchased only 2 months ago, the sound quality began failing and so I contacted Amazon to report it.  They directed me to Apple as the product was still under manufacturer warranty.  When I explained situation to Apple representative, the serial number for the item was not in the Apple database.  So they directed me back to Amazon. I also purchased Apple Care from Amazon which made no sense if the Airpods were not actually an Apple product.  I believe this is false advertisement that the Airpods were sold under the ""Apple"" name as well as selling me ""Apple care"" for a ""non Apple product"".  I was refunded for both, but very disappointed."
2749,"June 18, 2020",2.0,Complete let down...,"  I have the first gen. AirPods for several years before I lost one to a dog incident and the other to a washing machine. LOVED THEM but didn't have the money to invest in a new pair at the time. Tried a few knockoff brands  for $20-$30 and had decent success but when I started travelling weekly for work, it was time to up the game again. Bought the new generation model and have been wildly disappointed ever since. Static regularly, battery life in average, on Zoom meetings they start going haywire at about the 40 minute mark and they only intermittently connect to my Microsoft Surface (which the knockoff brands had no problem doing). Maybe I just got a bunk pair of these but if I could go back to the originals I would. If I could also get my $200 back, I'd do that too. Sometimes newer isn't better."
2750,"June 18, 2020",5.0,As described,  As described
2751,"June 18, 2020",5.0,Delivery,"  I was very disturbed to see that my package was open.  Luckily the Apple box was shrink wrapped and the product was not disturbed.  Don't know how it happened.  I am replacing my AirPods as my first ones were lost.  I love the product, just concerned about the package being tampered with."

2756,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Quick and as promised!,  High quality AirPods and they arrived with next day shipping! Very happy with my purchase!
2757,"June 17, 2020",4.0,U get what u get,"  I've never owned Airpods, thisbis my first time. I came back to the site to do a review and decided to read through some of the others...long story short this led to me looking at each earpiece under a magnifier. Mine came brand new in shrink wrapped box however the left pod is gen 1 and the right is gen 2 (according to the model numbers).When I take 1 out it still plays music. Idk if that normal or not be I've never had airpods before, plus I'm using them with android galaxy. Other than that I haven't had any real issues with them.Decided not to ask for a replacement though...I wouldn't want to end up with some terrible/used/dirty ones."
2758,"June 17, 2020",2.0,really easy to lose and you can’t track them,  lost them. hate that for me!
2759,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Best buds I have tried awesome all the way around!!!!!,  All around awesome. For me these are the most comfertable by far. They sound awesome and I should have went with them from the getgo

2764,"June 17, 2020",1.0,broken airpods,  airpods won't connect to my iphone
2765,"June 17, 2020",3.0,don’t expect them to be clean,  i bought these used and they were obviously not cleaned. there was earwax stuck in the airpods and in the case. pretty gross. the mic also doesn’t work in either airpod so i can’t use them for facetime or phone calls. you get what you pay for
2766,"June 17, 2020",4.0,Love it,"  Love this. I wish the battery will last longer. Being a little greedy, 23/7 would be nice. One hour for charging."
2767,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  I buy two.it so nice.
2768,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Exactly as advertised,  Came new in box
2769,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Airpods,   Love them🥰
2770,"June 17, 2020",1.0,Don't recommend buying,  They worked fine for about a month then the right airpod started having problems connecting which eventually turned it to that pod not keeping a charge. Now neither  airpod connects and after troubleshooting per Apple's instructions the airpods can no longer be found
2771,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  Came brand new !
2772,"June 17, 2020",1.0,No sound!,  Literally used the AirPods one time and the second time I tried to put them on they completely stopped working.
2773,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Awesome Buy!!!,  Great price and easy gift for Mother's Day while having know where else to shop.
2774,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Excelente
2775,"June 17, 2020",1.0,BUY THE REAL ONE AT APPLE,"  I HAD THIS FOR 3 days and ONE SIDE STOP WORKING , don’t buy it 💀💀💀💀"
2776,"June 17, 2020",1.0,No you shouldn’t buy these.,  The airpods are difficult to connect and there is a serious static problem.
2777,"June 17, 2020",4.0,One dies faster then the other,  Amazing AirPods but one dies faster then the other ..other then that I recommend these they are amazing.
2778,"June 17, 2020",1.0,They didn’t work straight out of the package.,  These are horrible. I never got to use them. They didn’t work straight out of the package. I charged them for hours and They did not work. Spend a few more dollars by brand new was. It will save you time and a headache
2779,"June 17, 2020",4.0,Great quality wireless headphones,  I have a ton of wireless headphones and it always seems hard to find ones that have good microphones on them for calls. These are some of the best quality wireless headphones out there. They are a little pricey but I guess you get what you pay for. I wish they had a version with behind the ear clips.
2780,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Good bluetooth earphones!,"  At first, I was skeptical about purchasing AirPods. However, after a week of using them I think they are amazing! They are easy to use and very convenient. The sound quality is wonderful as well. Also, it has many cool features, but my favorite one is the automatic ear detection which detects when your AirPod falls out of your ear. I recommend purchasing these if you have an Apple device and are looking for easy/convenient earphones."
2781,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great  product!
2782,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Straightforward,  I got this for my sister for her birthday and I wasn’t expecting it to come in the apple box but it did. I was satisfied with my purchase because it was a little bit cheaper then going into the store and it came in time for her birthday. Even after all of COVID they were fast at what they do. I highly recommend buying from here again and I probably would buy their products knowing that they are legit and that they work.
2783,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Arrived as promised,  I'm guessing they are good it was a gift
2784,"June 17, 2020",5.0,For my husband,  Bought these for my husband.  He loves them. They arrived quickly.  Price is compatible to market.
2785,"June 17, 2020",5.0,Awesome,"  My husband bought me these, I honestly didn’t want them because I have tried other wireless ear buds and they hurt so badly. But these are awesome!!! So comfortable and the sound quality Amazing."
2786,"June 17, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy was sold a defect pair,  I am very disappointed with this product there is a weird noise it makes here and there when being used. I’ve tried to exchange but it says my timeframe is up. These are new was only used a few times. I assume I was sold a defect pair of AirPods and is very disappointed because my money was wasted
2787,"June 17, 2020",4.0,One of the best Apple inventive product,"  One of the best Apple inventive product so far. Great sound and convenient to use. When use, you will need be careful with water. It destroys the microphone inside of it, take it of when washing face!"

2794,"June 16, 2020",2.0,Just purchase them from Apple,  I’ve had these for 2 months and the right pod has gone bad. I can barely hear out of it and of course now I can return or exchange them. I tried to go through Apple. It because the store is closed Incant get any help/resolution. $140.00 down the drain. Purchase them directly from Apple. Extremely disappointed
2795,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Best purchase ever
2796,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Don’t hold the charge longer then 7 hours,  Great product . love them so much had to get one more pair for my husband

2799,"June 16, 2020",3.0,One out,  One if the pod stop working
2800,"June 16, 2020",3.0,Battery life not so good,  It’s convenient because I can charge my phone without having to stop using it. Only thing I don’t like is that battery wise it last me three hours on each ear piece
2801,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Airpods,"  Nice airpods, the sound are very loud and perfect."
2802,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Just what he needed :),  My son was looking for a new pair of headphones and we found a good deal with the these Airpods. They arrived quickly and with no issues. Thank you!
2803,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Excellent
2804,"June 16, 2020",5.0,😊,  Good service
2805,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Good product.,  Working outside.
2806,"June 16, 2020",2.0,Do not buy damaged box!!,  Item was supposed to be new with damaged box. The airpods had ear wax on them and were already used .
2807,"June 16, 2020",5.0,A MUST HAVE!!,"  I LOVE THEM!! I use it everyday. I workout 5x a week, chill Saturday and clean Sunday and let me tell you, it’s worth the buy!"
2808,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Great,  Very good and great sound quality!
2809,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Goood,  Gooooof
2810,"June 16, 2020",3.0,Ehh,"  I’ve had a few issues with these. They have randomly shocked my ear. I’ve had issue with them syncing to my phone, or one earphone won’t come on. When I open my case, they wont show in my phone screen anymore.  I am not sure if these have been refurbished or I just got a not so great pair. You might be better off finding something a little cheaper."
2811,"June 16, 2020",5.0,You won’t buy another pod.,  I have tried many ear pods and these are the best.
2812,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,"  I love these so much! In fact, I’m using them right now! They aren’t really noise canceling at all but sometimes that’s good because when your wearing them you don’t realize if your being talked to or not so if you turn them low enough you’ll hear the music perfectly and hear the outside world perfectly! I wish they were cheaper but I still love them!"
2813,"June 16, 2020",3.0,Dependable so far.,  I bought a different type of ear buds that did not last. I decided to get the Apple name brand. They are expensive but I didn’t want to spend money on off brand ear buds that broke down all the time. This Apple Air Buds was easy to install and sync both buds together. Not the greatest sound but okay for me. Battery life was good also.
2814,"June 16, 2020",5.0,very skeptical now very impressed,"  my big concern was apple headphones have historically never worked for me and always fall out, these do not have that problem at all"
2815,"June 16, 2020",3.0,My Review,  I ordered these air pods and I received them about a week ago. Everything is great accept when I’m on the phone. The air pods begin making a weird distorted noise and makes the other person sound weird. This only happens after being on the phone for a few minutes. I would like a new pair that hopefully doesn’t do this. Other than that the airpods are great.
2816,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Nice gift!,  Bought for my grandson- he was extremely happy!
2817,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Love them
2818,"June 16, 2020",5.0,THEY ARE ORIGINAL AIRPODS !!!!!!!!,"  they came in a newest packaging, everything clean and beautiful. work very well, i love that amazon sells it for a price lower than apple. LOVE AMAZON. so glad!!!"
2819,"June 16, 2020",5.0,Genuine new apple airpods gen 2,  Genuine new apple airpods gen 2 at first i was unsure but took the risk
2820,"June 16, 2020",5.0,AirPods,"  Los amo 😍 son muy buenos, la batería dura mucho"
2821,"June 16, 2020",3.0,'New' airpods had earwax,"  These arrived with earwax in them so obviously they were not new. The picture is all of the earwax that I scraped off of the airpods with a toothpick. I also wiped them down with rubbing alcohol wipes to clean them and get everything completely off. When I tried to use them, they were already registered to somebody as well. Otherwise, they are a great product."
2822,"June 15, 2020",5.0,my kid loves them,"  had to order them for my kid, of course he's an apple fanboy and can't imagine anything thats not ibrand.  i can't tell you what exactly it is because i dont get it, but he's 100% in love with these earbuds so you get my 5-star review.sidenote - i can't imagine they sound $150 better than my weird off-brand ones, but hey whatever - they're worth the cost to him (he paid for them), so who am i to judge?"
2823,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Wireless and Worth The Hype,"  These AirPods are definitely the real deal. Don’t fret over not buying them from Apple directly. Battery life is very good, however I’m a little disappointed in the sound quality. I expected them to be louder even when on low-ish volumes, but I definitely have to turn the volume up about halfway to clearly hear a TV show or video. They are a bit more cooperative while listening to music and the double tap controls on the AirPods work well. Overall very satisfied with this purchase."
2824,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Buy THEM!,  I used it for music.
2825,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Battery life could be better but I definitely love them.
2826,"June 15, 2020",1.0,Never will I buy again!!!,  Ordered them the first pair the right airpod went out. Now the second pair the right side has gone out.
2827,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Great,  Breyer than I expected
2828,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Authentic Apple AirPods!!,  Very satisfied with my purchase!! Brand new in Apple packaging!! Authentic Apple product!! Would highly recommend!!
2829,"June 15, 2020",5.0,As expected,  Love them
2830,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Apple air pods,  They are amazing and have very good quality
2831,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Great buy,"  Easy to switch back and forth between devices. They’re very light and easy to wear, so happy I pulled the trigger and got these. It’s so convenient when you’re on the phone and don’t want to worry about your phone or cords!"
2832,"June 15, 2020",1.0,Came in broken,  I brought these when my beats were stolen; When they came in both headphones were blown out.
2833,"June 15, 2020",5.0,"Loved them, thank you",  Loved them thank you
2834,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Worth it!,"  Enjoying them more than I thought I would. Had a pair of headphones I used and I love being able to listen to music, phone calls etc without an annoying cord getting in the way."
2835,"June 15, 2020",4.0,What I was expecting,"  The battery last very long on both the AirPods and the charging case. Sometimes they go wild and refuse to connect to my iPhone but it I try again 10 minutes later they usually work. Also most of my problems are simply user error, because I tuck my hair behind my ears offer which causes my to hang up on people, skips songs, or pause things I am watching."
2836,"June 15, 2020",4.0,Needs to come with a brick,  This is a great product and quite pricey.  I would’ve given five stars if it had come complete with a brick  to charge it up.  Apple needs to  get better at sending the complete product.
2837,"June 15, 2020",3.0,Worth the difference vs low cost ear phones?,  Very expensive with not so much difference vs the 30-40 usd options.
2838,"June 15, 2020",3.0,"easy to pair, terrible battery life","  It is amazingly easy to pair these bluetooth earphones and to switch between devices, which is why I bought them.  However, they are equally easy to knock out of your ears if you have long hair (so you may need to buy a cord to connect them and to hang around your neck).  My biggest complaint is the cruddy standby battery life.  If you leave them in your ears without any music playing the battery will still be dead in around 2 hours.  That is no where near the 5 hours of music per charge promised by Apple!  At this point I'm banking on durability to make up for the high price.  If these die in 6 months like all my other bluetooth headphones I will be furious and go back to cheaper alternatives with better battery life."
2839,"June 15, 2020",1.0,"Junk, good for one month",  Junk! Stopped working after I month of use.  Save your money!!
2840,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  My daughter loves. She had a problem with one earbud but spoke with someone at Amazon (who btw was awesome) and she fixed it.
2841,"June 15, 2020",5.0,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,  EXCELENTE
2842,"June 15, 2020",1.0,Was sold old used AirPods instead of new,  Very disappointed in how I received one of the AirPods. They are used with a dirty box and actual case inside was not sealed and a broken charging cable and the box was not sealed on both AirPod boxes. I specifically order new AirPods not used!!! Also right pod is not working and can’t use them for calls either.
2843,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  These synced super fast and the sound is awesome. The batteries charge pretty quick and last.
2844,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Perfect fit and sound is awesome! This style of earbuds do not hurt my ears. They do not however cancel out noise unless volume is up higher than normal.
2845,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Awesome!,  I use these for work as I am on the phone frequently while traveling. I also listen to music with them.
2846,"June 15, 2020",4.0,Love them!,"  My left airpod stopped working, but I don’t think that has anything to do with ordering from here. They were amazing, I finally understand the craze. Just know the charger light is inside the case, not outside."
2847,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Noise cancelling,"  One of the first times I used my AirPods for a phone call, the person on the phone said “wow I can hear you so much better! There’s no background noise!” These are great for my job, makes it easy to talk on the phone and walk around. Very satisfied"
2848,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Clarity is awesome,  Love AirPods! They have been a game changer. Unfortunately I returned them because all I needed was the case and not the pods. However my pods are not holding a charge and need it sent back or reorder.
2849,"June 15, 2020",3.0,only last few months,  only last few months before one goes out  usual crap
2850,"June 15, 2020",4.0,Worth it!,"  At first I was skeptical in buying this off Amazon and thought I’d be getting a knock off but I can say I’m definitely impressed. I decided to buy 2 pairs of these, one for myself and one for my husband for a Father’s Day gift. Working from home, I was getting tired of wearing a headset taking calls and having zoom meetings. This has definitely been a game changer for me. I love that I am able to connect it to my phone, laptop, and car with Bluetooth. It’s great that when I want to figure out what my battery percentage is for both the charging case and AirPods, it’ll tell me on my phone just by opening the charging case and the percentage for both will appear on the bottom of my phone screen. You can also tell when your case needs to be charged because there will be an orange light and if it’s charged enough, the light will be green as I show in the pictures. Same with the headphones. If you place the AirPods into the charging cradle, there will be an orange light if the charge is low and a green light when they are fully charged. These are not something you can wear for an entire day because the inside of your ear can become sore so I wear them when it’s necessary during my day. I love that there’s a feature where if I do have my headphones on, Siri will read my messages to me and you can send a reply as well. Siri feature is definitely great for when I am in the middle of something. Battery life, these haven’t lasted me for an entire day. I also love that when the AirPods are about to die, there’s a DUN-DUN noise that plays to let you know put me on the chargerrrrr. Other than that, I’m satisfied with my purchase and my husband will love the surprise when he receives it."
2851,"June 15, 2020",5.0,They're great,"  I bought them regardless the concern I got when I read some bad reviewes here, at the end of the day I'm glad I bought them, they are airpods model a2032 a2031 a1602, 100% 2nd generation and brand new. Just be sure to buy them from ""Amazon.com Services LLC"" rather any other seller."
2852,"June 15, 2020",2.0,They don’t last past 6 months very disappointed,  I really liked them but the right ear bud stopped working after 6 months and I didn’t use them very often!
2853,"June 15, 2020",5.0,Excellent!,"  Works amazing, sound is great and awesome it charges in the case. Worth the money!"
2854,"June 14, 2020",3.0,this is 2nd generration airpods with first generation case,  i dont like that its 2nd generation airpods with a non wirless case socthere are not the wireless charging ones if you guys are wondering
2855,"June 14, 2020",5.0,De buena calidad,  Fue el mejor regalo para mi hijo en su cumpleaños le encanto

2857,"June 14, 2020",1.0,Stopped working in 4 months,  Bought these in November 2019 and one stopped working in 4 months with no damage. Disappointed that I didn’t even get a year of use. Don’t waste your money.
2858,"June 14, 2020",5.0,Great Buy,  So happy they came in was a gift for the other ones I didn’t receive. The person that I gifted them to absolutely loved them. Worth the extra money.
2859,"June 14, 2020",5.0,As good as expected!,  As good as expected!
2860,"June 14, 2020",5.0,Amazing product!,"  Best headphones ive ever used, clear sound, never fall out of my ears and stay charged all day! Highly recommend!"
2861,"June 14, 2020",1.0,Really really awful. Don’t buy it,"  It will work for like a month but then one side stops working. Before purchasing, I saw some other reviewers having the same issue but I hesitated to listen to them and went ahead with the purchase. Now, I’m realizing that I should’ve listened to them. I want to return it but get at least partial refund but that’s not possible before my return window has closed. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this. What’s really disturbing is that it’s an amazon choice, which makes it sounds like it’s the original and quality version of an apple product you’re buying but instead this piece of crap is nothing but disappointment and regrets."
2862,"June 14, 2020",4.0,Good,"  Good quality, great sound but sometimes fall out of my ears"
2863,"June 14, 2020",5.0,Yes get themmmmm,  I definitely would have to say this is my favorite thing that I bought all year long this is a must have if you’re an Apple lover
2864,"June 14, 2020",5.0,"Don’t waste your money on off brand, just get the apple ones.😀",  Don’t waste your money on off brand air pods.... just get the real thing. They are so worth it.👌🏻

2868,"June 14, 2020",5.0,Genuine Apple AirPods,  My 2nd pair...my son threw my 1st set in the trash. Works just as great as the set I bought from the Apple store
2869,"June 14, 2020",5.0,buy them !,  they are what you expect !
2870,"June 14, 2020",4.0,Needs fine tuning,"  When I use the headphones on a voice call or what have you, people say they can still hear my dog whine in the background. Have had a few instances with static. Cool to get when on sale if you're big into Apple products. Easy to carry. Decent battery."
2871,"June 14, 2020",1.0,STAY AWAY!!,"  These AirPods are Replicas and they are FAKE. The actual real ones are 20 dollars more from Walmart or Bestbuy. Please don’t waste your moneyed time, they won’t last over a year. Avoid these at all cost"
2872,"June 14, 2020",4.0,Just like buying from apple,  Just like buying from apple

2876,"June 14, 2020",5.0,Much better than the previous ones! better battery life!,"  AirPods deliver up to two times faster switching between active devices, “50% faster when transferring a call to your AirPods”, and “deliver 30% lower gaming latency."
2877,"June 14, 2020",5.0,These are legit!,"  Legit AirPods (when you get them, go to the Apple website to verify legitimacy if that is a concern for you). I was mostly worried about them falling out when I go for a walk/run and they stayed in place and lasted the whole time. Love them!"
2878,"June 14, 2020",5.0,nice product,"  was purchased as a gift, a little pricey"

2884,"June 13, 2020",1.0,"Was AirPods Version 1, and would not pair or reset.","  I ordered the type ""AirPods + Charging Case"" on June 10th, 2020. (I followed the link back to here on the day I got the package to write this review.I received a nice looking set of Airpods version 1, not version 2.(The light is located on the inside of the case, so it's definitely a version 1. )It charged up fine, I left it plugged in for a few hours, but it would not pair to either of our iPhones, nor our new iPad or Macbooks.I tried resetting, holding the button down for 10 seconds, then 15, then 30 seconds. No change, stayed white. According to Apple's site a reset turns amber. No change after, still did not pair.Sending it back. I was expecting an AirPod version 2, and I was expecting it would pair."
2885,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Worth the $$,  I've been using the Sony Noice Cancelling Headphones for about 2 years now.. While they're comfortable they weren't really meant to use when working out.  These are and the ease of connectivity is great.  I even use these when I'm at work if I need to answer a phone call but not near my phone.  Happy with the purchase.
2886,"June 13, 2020",4.0,Story you should know,"  Well you know what it is it’s Apple hahah lol lmao the best quality all of there items, never had a problem with Apple except pricing hahah lol any how I got my first and only AirPods form amazon well it was nice and I enjoyed for more than 4 month, but suddenly the left side stopped working ... and guess what I have no Apple protection and I was so sad so I called amazon for assistance so I told them everything we tried every possible options but it still doesn’t work so they connected me to Apple customer service well, they told me they couldn’t do anything and that I have to buy 69 bucks for the single  piece and I said no.... and that was it ......::((( End of my AirPod era"
2887,"June 13, 2020",5.0,coolio,  they have no wires? wack
2888,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Love them!!,  I want to love them but the right AirPod can’t hold a charge.Update: I returned the old pair and received the new pair... I love them!!! If your thinking about getting a pair get them you won’t be disappointed!

2896,"June 13, 2020",1.0,Don't Bother,"  Do yourself a favor, buy them from Apple where you know they won't randomly stop working - these airpods have probably sat in a warehouse for a long time. Amazon was a pain with the replacement and refunding the purchase.You pay extra from Apple.com but at least the airpods work."
2897,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  She loved them
2898,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Worth the price,  Battery life is amazing they charge so fast and they last pretty long.  10/10 highly recommend. You might want to order a case as well white can get boring you might want to jazz it up. Also if you see any chips on the charging case that's my fault I dropped it on concrete.

2903,"June 13, 2020",5.0,perfect!! :),"  these are the real deal, paired perfectly with my ipad and phone- came almost fully charged in the apple box still wrapped, and they work and look just as they are supposed to! super excited!!"
2904,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Real AirPods. Great listening. Could use a longer battery life,  I mean they’re Apple so you know the sound quality is there. It’s very freeing to have Bluetooth headphones and they’re pretty comfortable.I had to give it a low rating on the battery life just because plenty of Bluetooth headphones come with an extremely long battery life (I’ve had Beats headphones that boast a 24-48 hr battery) and it’s a little disappointing given that Apple is a very well established company.I also checked the serial number of my pods and the validity of the warranty on Apple’s website. I can confirm that I received real AirPods. I would suggest anyone who is uncertain about buying from Amazon due to authenticity just make sure you’re not buying third party and check the serial number on Apples website so if you receive fakes you can get Amazon support on it right away. Serial number is located on the inside-top-left of the case.
2905,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Love it!,  I received it in good condition and very good quality 👍👍
2906,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Good,  I love the AirPods I just wish they had noice cancellation
2907,"June 13, 2020",3.0,I wish battery would last longer and hour,  I love these pods but battery life is weak!
2908,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Real deal,  Idk how people get fake ones because I got the real ones and they’re AMAZING
2909,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Love my some airpods,  I love these little things. My bosses gave me a gift card for amazon and I splurged and bought them. Great quality would buy again.
2910,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Very light and effective speakers,  The sound quality is very good and they are light and easy to wear. The battery lasts multiple days
2911,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Excellent product
2912,"June 13, 2020",5.0,Best on the market!,"  2nd set I have bought, the best on the market! Off brands just aren’t the same."
2913,"June 13, 2020",1.0,Empty box,  Got an empty box.Read the recent reviews.I got it refunded and bought one directly from apple
2914,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Best Airpods for this price,  Best Airpods for the price. If you are using iphone then you will have more advantage of using it.
2915,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Great Quality. Price could be cut down though.,  Im amazed at how good the quality of the sound is for it being wireless!!
2916,"June 12, 2020",5.0,A must have,  Loving this
2917,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Happy to hear,  Needed a new pair of headphones and my roommate talked me into these 😂
2918,"June 12, 2020",2.0,AirPods are useful and easy. But right AirPod does not work,  Right AirPod does not work.... will be returning
2919,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods.,  Good quality and performance. Long battery life.
2920,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
2921,"June 12, 2020",3.0,Great until you lose them,  These were the best ear buds I ever had until I lost them. Apple Care wasn’t even worth adding on as they do not replace for a lower price if you lost the whole thing. Airpods and case. You’re paying more than when you first bought them.
2922,"June 12, 2020",1.0,More for clout and style than actually using as headphones,  VERY disappointed with sound quality! I’ve bought $20 headphones that have Better noise cancelation than these. Ended up returning because they kept falling out of my ears as well. Save your money and don’t give in to the trend
2923,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Air pods,  Great Apple product. Got exactly what I expected.
2924,"June 12, 2020",5.0,"Great price, nice quality.","  Bought these as a birthday gift, super fast delivery.  They work great, nice clarity and easy to use."
2925,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Great,  Work great
2926,"June 12, 2020",4.0,Great sound but falls out of ears,  Won’t stay in your ears well.  Battery needs a charge each day a few times.  But talk and sound is extremely clear.  Pairs to your phone in seconds easily.
2927,"June 12, 2020",1.0,Fake Airpods,"  In order to determine whether or not these AirPods were real, I immediately checked to see if the serial number matched Apple's official website. The number couldn't be verified. After opening the box, I noticed two things: ""the Designed by Apple in California"" was black, not grey, and inside the case were small black particles. Not only was it until I visited helpful websites that explain how to spot fake AirPods that I knew these were fake. Please don't be fooled by the packaging!Of course, this does not mean that all airpods from Amazon are fake. A friend of mine purchased them from here last year and hers was verifiable. So, I think it's a case-by-case situation. Make sure to do some research once you receive the package!Overall, I was looking so forward to finally purchasing my first Airpods, but the end result was very dismaying and disappointing. Although it would cost more, to play it safe, I would recommend purchasing from the official website!"
2928,"June 12, 2020",5.0,simp,  i gave to the girl i simping for and she loved them
2929,"June 12, 2020",3.0,NOT AirPod 2 - don’t let the question/answers fool you,"  I was really looking forward to getting AirPods for my new job. These have good sound quality and, so far, the battery life has been good. However, these are NOT AirPod 2 like many people answered above. I know this because I checked the hardware version after they were connected to my phone.If you are looking for AirPods for a decent price, get these. If you are looking for AirPod 2, keep looking."
2930,"June 12, 2020",5.0,AirPods,"  Love them, great upgrade!"
2931,"June 12, 2020",5.0,LOVE my AirPods,"  I lost my first pair of AirPods and had to repurchase because I can't live without them. I was hesitant about ordering from amazon because some people have complained about receiving fakes but luckily, the AirPods that I got were 100% legitimate. I immediately verified by checking the serial number on Apple.com."
2932,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Na,  Na
2933,"June 12, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  These AirPods works perfectly I’ve have them for a while now . They’re still working fine.
2934,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Very nice 2nd gen NOT 1ST GEN,  Very nice but wireless case costs extra. But it is not Gen 1 the number says its Gen 2 also its not fake
2935,"June 12, 2020",1.0,Broke in 2 weeks,"  BROKE after 2 weeks of use. Never dropped or abused the product. Charged it the night before, took it off the charger to go to the gym that next day - won’t turn on at all. Might not be a authentic Apple product!!!"
2936,"June 12, 2020",5.0,upgrading my airpods,"  I had the 1st gen airpods for a while and loved them. Only after a while the battery started to die, it would only last 20-30 mins at best. So I upgraded to a new 2nd gen pair and so far the battery life has been fantastic compared to what I was dealing with previously. Overall, these are so much nicer to wear than wired headphones. I'd recommend them to anyone considering upgrading from the default apple headphones."
2937,"June 12, 2020",5.0,i like,  I really like the quality and the price...cant go wrong 👍🏼
2938,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Great Buy,  I love them!  I’m going to order another pair for my little sister!
2939,"June 12, 2020",2.0,"So smart they're stupid. DON""T BUY Airpods","  I have had nothing but issues with these.Apple tried to make these so smart, but they never work as intended. Use them for meetings but when you touch or adjust them in your ears, they disconnect you from the call. I have double tap actions turned off.I go on runs with them and enjoy the sound and the comfort. Other than that, the software and function of them are awful. Don't join an important meeting with these unless you plan on sitting absolutely still and not touching them.I can't believe how bad these were engineered."
2940,"June 12, 2020",2.0,Not good quality,  Half the time it doesn’t read my texts when they come through and doesn’t even show that as an option In settings. Other times it’ll work fine. I’ve had lots of issues with them not connecting and working properly. Not happy with them at all
2941,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Product didn’t come with a charger!!,  Absolutely love!...but was a little upset it didn’t come with a charger.
2942,"June 12, 2020",4.0,EAR SPECIFIC and QUALITY,"  A FEW DAYS AFTER MY REVIEW...CHANGE THE 5 STAR TO 4: It’s stilly excellent. My friends can hear me very well and I, them. Their complain is there hearing a lot of background noise and apparently, I can do nothing to stop that.  I thought I’d use them for conversation in store, but now, I hesitate to do so, because friends would be side tracked with all the sound around me.  Still the best I could find and the best that is recommended by my friends. FIRST REVIEW WAS 5 start—as follows: Silly thought, right? Everything about these ear buds is what I hoped.....quality. How hard It is, purchasing anything these days and being anxious about the quality or lack there of, no matter what you pay for the product. (If this is confusing to you, please read the novel  Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand.) The ear specific fit, sound quality, apperance.....all are wonderful. Ease of connecting to any of my devices....WONDERFUL. I cannot rate construction longevity nor battery life, because I have only had them for a few days, and before that, I had the plug in buds that I rarely used, because I kept sitting the phone down to use my hands in the kitchen, and dragging my phone off Of a surface by moving around. Trying to hear friends on their speakers, because they are busy, too became frustrating. This WAS the perfect answer. They hear me better and finally, I can hear them even when they turn their back to their phone.  You will hear from me if they break down anytime soon.....promise. Since my iphone is the new SE2020, trouble shooting, if any problem arrises, will definitely be a breeze. I am so enjoying these airbuds. Voice activation helped type this review."
2943,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Wireless Ear buds are amazing,  Love my ear buds.  Great price fast shipping
2944,"June 12, 2020",1.0,Third pair won't connect either,"  My first pair of airpods were the generation 1s.  They were great for a couple months and then they would not connect to my iPhone.  This has happened now with my third pair.  I usually only wear one airpod (left ear) while at work and that is the first to go, every time.  I'm hoping Apple will improve the durability of this product in the future.  It does not look promising as gen 1 and gen 2 were both very bad quality in terms of longevity of the product."
2945,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Perfect gift!!,  It was a Mother’s Day gift! Came right on time!
2946,"June 12, 2020",5.0,Works with Android,  Works pretty well with my S10+.

2953,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Great gift idea.,  Wife loves this gift.
2954,"June 11, 2020",4.0,Cool,  Just as described
2955,"June 11, 2020",5.0,I love em!,"  I never thought I would like these. I guess it’s because I’m not of the younger generation and I just got used to the wired headsets. I was wrong, wrong, wrong. These things are awesome! Very clear and they sound great. Now don’t tell my wife, but I sneak them into my pocket and listen to songs I downloaded (don’t tell her about those either) while driving the tractor in the fields. If y’all tell her it will ruin my whole grumpy old never gonna change persona I’ve got going, so keep it to yourselves!  Anyway, these things are awesome!"
2956,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Love it,  So crisppp I love it!!!Happy with my purchase (:

2960,"June 11, 2020",5.0,perfect,"  nice, worth it"
2961,"June 11, 2020",1.0,Faulty left Earpod,  These headphones appeared fine at first.But after just 6 weeks of using them the left earpod began to glitch. At first I let it slide thinking it could be a one-time thing.It simply runs out of battery much earlier than the right one even though both claim to have the same amount of battery life.Sometimes it will even die at “60% or 70%” battery.Disappointed
2962,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Definitely worth the buy,  I am very happy with my Airpods! They came packaged well and they work perfectly!
2963,"June 11, 2020",1.0,DONT BUY,  Left Ear didn't work. nothing helped.
2964,"June 11, 2020",5.0,"Good quality, long battery life",  Love these I’ve tested them for a month and they did not disappoint!
2965,"June 11, 2020",5.0,First air pods,  Bought these for my wife who is not strong on the technical side and needed something that works perfectly in pairing and calls without ANY issues. Home run on the suppose gift.
2966,"June 11, 2020",5.0,sound quality is great,  Liked everything about them
2967,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Convenient,"  It's obviously very convenient, easy to charge, long battery life, wireless. It doesn't fall out of your ear easily, but it is only a simple wireless airpods, do not expect too much about noise reduction."

2972,"June 11, 2020",5.0,comfy & easy,  the air pods fit great in my ears and have pretty decent quality
2973,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
2974,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Gives me joy on a daily basis .,"  I use them on a daily basis and I have amazing experience... The sound is so clear and loud ,noice cancelation on point . Worth their price for sure ."

2976,"June 11, 2020",5.0,THE best accessory for Apple Devices!!!,  Did you know you can connect your AirPods to your Apple TV ???? Last night when my fiancé and son were sleeping I was watching The Vampire Diaries until like 4 am !!😂 they slept sound and I watched my show above whisper level!!!! 10/10 I recommend
2977,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Love,"  These little babies are everything I wanted! The first set I bought from another, will remain nameless, site were terrible. This set has been worth every penny!"
2978,"June 11, 2020",2.0,7-8 months later and one headphone went out.,"  The headphones aren't noise cancelled. When I first brought them they were good. I had the headphones for about 7-8 months now, one of the headphones just went out. The sound is just low now. I tried restarting the settings, cleaned them and all of that but it still doesn’t work."
2979,"June 11, 2020",5.0,When the commercial mower runs over the AirPods,"  So far so good.First day, first hour of use I was landscaping and using a commercial mower. I wasn’t use to them, I turned my head and the right one fell out, I couldn’t and didn’t stop the mower in time.....Off goes the one AirPod into the field.I find it moments later.. with no scratch do dings, nothing wrong with it.Put it in my ear, immediately connected to my phone, made and received calls perfect.Some how I lucked out."
2980,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Excelente
2981,"June 11, 2020",5.0,Best it is,  Apple airpods are perfect for me. It helps me a lot. I got it in so perfect condition. It was packed so good and yes thank you so much.
2982,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Happy customer,  Great product and fast delivery. Thanks
2983,"June 10, 2020",5.0,ITS LEGIT,"  got this for my girlfriend and i was a bit skeptical because it’s an apple product from another website, but it was all legit, 100% would recommend"
2984,"June 10, 2020",5.0,I’m so happy I got them,  Love them
2985,"June 10, 2020",1.0,Just a empty box,"  When I received my package, it was an empty box! No charging case or AirPods!"
2986,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Great product !,  Brand new packaging and charging case. It’s really an Apple product.
2987,"June 10, 2020",1.0,DEAD 1 month after 1-year warranty,"  Convenient and small, but no longevity. Definitely disappointed since it costs so much.Either pay for apple care, or go with a product that was developed to last."
2988,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Fantastic,  OMG. These are the best ever. I actually forget I have them in. The sound is fantastic. I use these while I cut the grass and it drowns out the noise.
2989,"June 10, 2020",3.0,Im not sure if is original! ? Battery life is not really good,"  Sound is good, works and connects well with iPhone. Touched on mode also works a sit should, what I’m not 100% sure is in battery life. Today it was fully charged, I used itFor a 50 minute workout and it was 67% battery life . Not sure if that’s normal or if this Podruct is not original ! I’m wondering 🤨"
2990,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Very good,  Very good
2991,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Tested the AirPods Pro And the Regular ones.,"  I purchased the AirPods and Airpods Pro. I decided to keep the regular ones just because they actually fit my ear a lot better EVEN THOUGH the  AirPods Pro have the adjustable features. If it wasn’t that I would have probably kept the AirPods Pro. The regular ones are annoying when you have to tap on/off, pause/start... the first tap never works. Sometimes you have to tap like an idiot. With the Pro it just always works. If you like the noise canceling, pro ones are great. If you want to know whats going on around you the  regular ones are better. ( airpods pro do have an option of turning off the noise canceling but even with it off i felt like I still wasn’t 100% aware of my surroundings)"
2992,"June 10, 2020",5.0,They are legitimate AirPods!!,  Great!
2993,"June 10, 2020",2.0,Horrible battery life,  My wife has airpods from the Apple store & her battery life on her case can last for days without recharging. She brought mine from amazon & I have to charge them every night before bed. If I would’ve known this would happen I would’ve asked her to spend the extra $30 to just get them from the Apple store.
2994,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods,  These are perfection.
2995,"June 10, 2020",5.0,LOVE THESE,  I held off buying these because I was convinced I would lose them. I finally caved during covid times and needing to workout from home. LOVE THESE. They are great to throw in and do chores or do a workout. They charge in a case  by iphone charger. The iphone will tell you the percentage the charging case and ear buds are charged. I have not had issues with the buds falling out. I have not had issue with the lack of noise cancellation.
2996,"June 10, 2020",5.0,As expected!,  They work perfect I’ve had them for a few months now and there as expected. I usually charge them about once a week but it depends on how often you use them. During quarantine I charge them like once a day 😂😂. They charge quickly tho so it’s fine. I often loose them but there easy to find with the Find My IPhone app (as long as the air pods have some power).
2997,"June 10, 2020",5.0,The real deal,  These are totally the real deal
2998,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Can easily get lost from ear or pocket,  Sound quality and connectivity Is awesome.

3000,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Original,  Buy from Apple Store or here..
3001,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Beyond Expectation,  Happy with my purchase and pricing!!! I barely EVER. Do reviews on products but this was bwyons expectation. I thought I was going to get crooked Hammy down I got a brand new box. :) perfect headset in perfect condition. Sealed and delivered!
3002,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Quality,  Wife loves them
3003,"June 10, 2020",4.0,Works well with Android devices but have some issues,"  I wanted wireless headphones because I wear them while I exercise outdoors in the morning and while I clean the house etc and was tired of getting hung up on the cord.  I bought these to use on my Galaxy S8 because there are no Android headphones on the market of this shape.  I can't stand the type that push into your ear canal so I was happy to read that these would work with android.  You don't get all the features with an android device obviously but that was of little concern to me.  I don't need to tell Siri to turn up the volume or battery life to be displayed on my screen.  The only issues I have are with the headphones themselves that have nothing to do with android usage.  First, they are a bit uncomfortable for someone with smaller ears I guess.  The hard plastic rubs on my inner ear with long usage.  My husband doesn't have this problem with his.  I am also have trouble with them cutting out a bit and sometimes going out of sync when I am using them to stream.  It is worse when I put my phone in my pocket.  I have read online that this is an issue with bluetooth so seems to be an issue with both apple and android devices."
3004,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Works great... 3 hr battery life
3005,"June 10, 2020",1.0,This was a bad buy,  It’s has not been working
3006,"June 10, 2020",5.0,AWESOME !,  Awesome! Brand new everything
3007,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Best Headphones I've owned!,"  I really love the airpods. I am glad I went with the regular instead of the pro for the price difference because these normal airpods are wonderful. I sweat a lot and they still stay in my ears, they cancel out other noise, and the sound quality is fantastic."
3008,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Audífonos,  Es lo mejor que he comprado!
3009,"June 10, 2020",5.0,No more snagging!,"  I run a lot and was thoroughly exhausted by my wires headphones always snagging on something. I put up with it for a long time because my prior experiences with Bluetooth anything had always been messy- it had always been a pain to get things to connect correctly, always some settings to fiddle with and turning it off and on again to reset something so that everything pairs up.  But these are quick and easy. Just pop them out of the case reasonably close to your phone and everything pairs up. As for the audio quality, it seems reasonably good. I’m no audiophile or anything, but I can’t really hear a difference between the AirPods and the wired set I was using before- admittedly the pair that came in the box with my phone.  Overall I’d say that if you, like me, are looking for something that’s easy to use and wire free, this is it chief."
3010,"June 10, 2020",5.0,100% Real,"  I ordered these about three weeks ago and was super anxious about them being real or fake, they are completely real as long as you get them sold and fulfilled by Amazon and not a third party.I love them! I never take them out (only to charge). I assume it is because of my ear shape but after a long time they do become uncomfortable, but I don’t mind. If you’re looking for a sign to get these, this is it! Get them."
3011,"June 10, 2020",1.0,Possible knock off,  If you only have one ear this product is perfect. As soon as the return window expired the right pod stopped working. They are probably knock offs.
3012,"June 10, 2020",5.0,They’re just great,"  I wear at home, work, gym. Basically everywhere."
3013,"June 10, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Umm Amazing of course
3014,"June 10, 2020",5.0,convenient,  I don't need to plug in the earphone cable
3015,"June 9, 2020",1.0,Won’t connect,  I bought a pair of these headphones and they would not connect to my phone. White light would not blink nor can you reset the AirPods.
3016,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Worth it.,  My husband loves them! Got them for an early anniversary gift and he uses them all the time.
3017,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Left one stopped working after very little use.,"  I bought them in March and maybe used them 6 times total, the left one stopped working and I can’t seem to reach anyone for support or returns. Very sad."

3019,"June 9, 2020",1.0,DISGUSTING.  USED NOT NEW,"  DISGUSTING!!!  So ticked-off!  Supposed to be new (at this price). However, can clearly tell they are USED, as have SOMEBODY ELSES EARWAX in the screen cover that goes right in ones ear!!!  How am I supposed to give this as a gift???  This is garbage! What game are you playing?  ZERO STARS!!!"
3020,"June 9, 2020",5.0,It’s loud ! 🤪,  It’s works great
3021,"June 9, 2020",1.0,Broken,"  Came broken. Right earbud did not work. Charged the case and when I went to connect them it wouldn’t show up because the right earbud wasn’t functioning, making the case not detect that there was an earbud in. With only one earbud detected, it’s impossible to connect to your phone if the case won’t allow it. Bad product."
3022,"June 9, 2020",5.0,They are perfect,  These are so good! And a great price! No defects with mine and new as well!!!
3023,"June 9, 2020",1.0,Poor quality.,  These AirPods won’t charge now.  Less than a year old.
3024,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Excellent very pleased,  They real work well and allow me to ride my bike without cords getting in the way

3032,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Great device,  Pros:amazing sound qualityconvenient modelbattery life may be improved even though holds wellNo complaints after 5 months of usage..and even after accidental laundry
3033,"June 9, 2020",1.0,BOXES WERE EMPTY,"  Guys be careful I ordered two Airpods and BOTH CASES WERE EMPTY. please just don't fall into their trap, it was really upsetting."
3034,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Amzing,  Amazing I lost my other pair and these are amazing
3035,"June 9, 2020",1.0,Used with EARWAX,  This was so bad it had earwax on it and it wasn’t worth the money. Wasn’t expecting that for the price I paid. I bought this like new
3036,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Perfect for Working at Home!,"  Extremely satisfied with quality and performance since purchasing in April. Has dramatically improved my work at home experience.  Ease of use, especially connectivity to my Bluetooth devices!"
3037,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Perfect product,"  incredible sound quality, it doesn't fall out of your ear for anything, even when running.  worth it"
3038,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Make the switch. You’ll be glad you did.,  I was a skeptic for so long but the slim profile and ease of use without chords I will never go back to wires. They pair instantly if you’re lazy like me that’s awesome and I can’t really speak to quality. They aren’t going to vibrate your ears with the bass but for podcasts and your average music listener they are perfect. Anyone who is on the phone for work a lot will love these as well. Very fast charging as well. I went from skeptic to advocate for these guys. They are quite expensive so I would only recommend if you use Bluetooth headphones heavily already.
3039,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Great product!,  Everything is good!
3040,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Amazing headphones!,  Great product.
3041,"June 9, 2020",1.0,empty box,  box was open and was empty- -ZERO STARS!!!
3042,"June 9, 2020",5.0,I bought it new and it’s just like my old ones and just can’t find my left pod for that one,  Legit😍 it came brand new from Apple.
3043,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Airpods are always good!,"  I got my first pair from Best Buy and they stopped working after a few months but hopefully these ones will last! I always loved my airpods...the design, the sound quality, and how lightweight they are. Would recommend them!!"
3044,"June 9, 2020",5.0,nice AirPods,  nice AirPods
3045,"June 9, 2020",5.0,I love these Gen 1 airpods so much!,"  I had borrowed a friend's old AirPods gen 1 for about 3 weeks until I had to give them back. After one week without AirPods filled with relentless struggle using cheaper wireless earbuds, I realized I had to buy my own pair! That one week was torture!I can't tell you how happy I am to be using these AirPods again! The design is sleek, slender and pocket-friendly. The wireless connection is superb between my iPhone and MacBook. Plus- if a friend also has airpods, you can ""bump"" your sound and listen to the same song, podcast or tv show coming from one apple device.A few things to note: these are NOT the wireless charging (gen 2) airports. They come with a lightning cable but NOT a charging block."
3046,"June 9, 2020",4.0,Mrs,  Easily falling off ears
3047,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Keep up with your air pods,  I love these air pods so much
3048,"June 9, 2020",3.0,Great sound,"  I love the sound and function, but they do not fit my ears, too big, they hurt after awhile."
3049,"June 9, 2020",5.0,What's not to Love?,  Love these ear pods.  They stay in my ears and hold their charge.  I use them daily during runs and workouts.
3050,"June 9, 2020",5.0,"I already loved them and then this happened, TWICE! Love these things!","  My Apple airpods have been great.  There are a couple of things that I was worried about that have happened like every so often they fall out of my ear when I bend over BUT I love having them for phone calls, for listening to music, audio books, etc.  AND on top of that, by accident, I have forgotten them in my pockets and they have gone through a load of laundry in the case once and out of the case once.  The second time they even went through the dryer.THEY STILL WORK!!!!! I couldn't believe it. I think they are sweat proof, but I never expected them to last through two loads of laundry.  Seriously couldn't believe it.  I'm very happy with these and hope at some point to get the new airpods with noise cancelling!  Thank you Apple for this great product!"
3051,"June 9, 2020",3.0,They say they are connected but won’t actually play over earbuds,  I have not had them a full month yet and they stopped connecting to my phone I had an off brand of earbuds over a year and didn’t have the issues I’ve had with these AirPods I was impressed for about a week now I will tell you don’t waste your money it’s just like every other over priced apple product...I believe the brand I previously had was Anzo ear buds they were water proof and worth the buy u like these overpriced earbuds
3052,"June 9, 2020",1.0,Broke Within Three Months,"  Purchased these airpods at the beginning of March, and they have already broke. It started with the left airpod not working, a week later the right airpod would not work. Disconnected and reconnected the Bluetooth many times, they still did not work. Updated my iPhone, they still would not work. Bummer for how much money was spent on them."
3053,"June 9, 2020",3.0,"Good quality and easy to use, disappointed that having trouble with them already","  I have had these less than a month and the R eat bud stopped working. I no longer get sound from it. I love my AirPods, but disappointed that I am already having problems with them"
3054,"June 9, 2020",5.0,Never wired headphones again!,  Impressed by the technology! Absolutely love this product and can’t imagine going back to wired headphones ever again! Downfall: sits so comfortably that I accidentally jumped in the shower with them on and realized when I ran my fingers through my hair - still work flawlessly! Would not shower with them on though...
3055,"June 9, 2020",4.0,Good overall,"  I really like my AirPods. I use them much more than I actually thought I would. The only issue I have is that my right AirPod dies much quicker than my left. They are both being used equally, but for some reason, this keeps happening. However, the battery life does last a while. I would recommend getting them if it really bugs you to have the original Apple earphones. Another really nice plus is that I can charge my phone and still listen to music; even from a distance!"
3056,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Get yours don’t think about it,  Very very good
3057,"June 8, 2020",3.0,Pathetic Sound Quality,  The $20 iPhone wired headphones I had for years have sound quality that far exceeds these airbuds.What happened to sound quality?
3058,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Best earphones,  I’ve tried so many different earbuds outside of the Apple brand. None of which fits my ears nicely as these. I like that I can still hear my surroundings while playing music because I work in an office environment. I don’t really like noise canceling so if that’s what you’re looking for these are not it. These are perfect for daily use. Charge lasts long. Pairs easily.
3059,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Original and very good!,  As advertised.
3060,"June 8, 2020",5.0,"Worth the money, use all the time!","  These were my Mother’s Day gift from my family. Last one in the family to get them. I kept saying I didn’t need, I liked my big headphones. I needed something smaller for Distance Learning - so many meetings on the computer! I LOVE THESE! I use them all of the time! Should have gotten them years ago!"
3061,"June 8, 2020",3.0,It’s okay,  Dies too fast.
3062,"June 8, 2020",2.0,Worked wonderfully until the left AirPod stopped working,  I had bought the AirPods in July and they had worked wonderfully till last week. In less than a year of use the left AirPod completely stopped working. I’ve used a different charging case and still no luck. I’m very disappointed.
3063,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Great for a gift,  Got these for my little sister she loves them
3064,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Good Buy,  Bought these for my preteen & he absolutely loves them
3065,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Worth It‼️
3066,"June 8, 2020",5.0,apple products are da best,  generic airpods are beautiful
3067,"June 8, 2020",3.0,1 Stopped working 4 months in,"  I take really good care of these, and use them often including while running. I liked them alot until one stopped working. Now I have to deal with contacting Apple and hoping they honor replacement for the 1 year warranty."
3068,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Muy bueno originales,  Muy bueno y nuevo así tienes que se todos los productos y si tienes aiphnes nuevo me avisa  originales
3069,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Apple is a brand and sound clarity is good and more over hands free.,  Apple products are always of good quality and maintain standards.
3070,"June 8, 2020",5.0,If you like loud music invest in better headphones.,  I barely use them but the sound is not as loud as you would want it to be. They have some cool features. But if you are going to spend a $150 on a pair of headphones get something with some bass.
3071,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Spl,  Spl
3072,"June 8, 2020",5.0,best earphones ever!,  totally worth the hype!! worth every penny
3073,"June 8, 2020",5.0,iPod ear buds,"  granddaughter loves them, they were a birthday gift."
3074,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Love these AirPods,  I love these AirPods! The reason I bought these is because they are wireless and not noise canceling. I can listen to music and still have conversations with my family.
3075,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Love them,  They are so good. Very easy to use auto connect. Don’t need to connect every time you use it. Once you pair them with any Apple device next time whenever you just out them in your ear it will be connected automatically.
3076,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Apple is the best!,  Terrific product and an authentic Apple product. So happy I went with the best instead of a lower quality to save the money.
3077,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Dependable,  Great product!
3078,"June 8, 2020",2.0,Painful,  I wanted these soooooo bad well guys one size does not fit all. My ears are small and they hurt soooo bad.My boyfriend purchased them for me so I wear them as long as I can I even had  sores in my ears from them He paid soooo much I just feel like I have to get some use out of them. I find myself reverting bank to my Pasonomi bluetooth earphones that I have purchased twice from amazon
3079,"June 8, 2020",1.0,Don’t believe the hype,  They wouldn’t connect & this is the 2nd pair I’ve ordered
3080,"June 8, 2020",4.0,Easy,  Good but some better
3081,"June 8, 2020",5.0,Just what I was looking for.,"  I bought a cheaper version and got what I paid for.  These made all the difference,  cost a bit more but well worth the expense.  sound is good and quality is better."
3082,"June 8, 2020",3.0,Subpar,  Are these refurbished because they don’t operate or last as new AirPods should
3083,"June 8, 2020",5.0,comfort and quality.,  I got these for my birthday last year and am in love with them.  I got them for my boyfriend this year for his birthday.  I dont think there has been a day in the last year where I didnt use them for music or a call.  They are so comfortable and no pressure in the ear.  Great sound quality on a call too.  We tested some calls BOTH using airpods too and the sound quality was fantastic.
3084,"June 8, 2020",5.0,great product,  awesome
3085,"June 8, 2020",2.0,"Not new, used items sold as new",  Came in packaging that looked new but was not fully sealed. When I opened and tried to connect to phone came up pre-labelled as “Lawrence’s air pods”...obviously not new. Then wouldn’t even connect and had to be returned.
3086,"June 8, 2020",1.0,died after 2 months AMAZON will not respond to help,  I have been trying to contact amazon but they dont allow calls or chat right now.. which is crazy... my ear pods DIED and have not worked (this was May and I purchased in March). I have NO WAY of contacting amazon for a replacement and I am so upset. I did love these but with this kind of customer service I would not purchase!!!
3087,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
3088,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Exactly what we wanted!
3089,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Music,  Nice
3090,"June 7, 2020",3.0,That the airpods box had small scartches on them,  The back of the airpods case had little scratches on them when I first got them but ignored the problem but I just wanted to let you know.
3091,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Excellent and comfortable,  no complaints just could be better noise
3092,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Work well,  Works amazingly well. Better than any other wireless headphone.
3093,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Love Apple!,  Love them!
3094,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Jd,  Love them
3095,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Great!,  These are so great and just as expected!
3096,"June 7, 2020",5.0,I love it.,"  They sound great, their battery life and charging speeds are really good."
3097,"June 7, 2020",5.0,"Simple, effective, very useful","  Once you get a pair of these you wonder how you lived without them! No messy cords, freedom of movement, walk around the room or office talking away to your heart's content! The battery life is good and if you remember to put them back in their case after each call (something I rarely do!) then they'll last even longer. A simple but very effective accessory from the folks at Apple."
3098,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Awesome
3099,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Love my AirPods!,  I love both running and good quality and my AirPods are great at both. They stay in my ears and the sound quality and bass is pretty good!
3100,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Love mu airbud,  Love it enjoying listening to my favorite music
3101,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Great gift,  It has a great microphone and it was a great product overall
3102,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Easy,  These are awesome! Their cordless and compact case make for easier listening.
3103,"June 7, 2020",2.0,Battery life isnt great,  I returned these after comparing to the Jabras (not great either).  The sound is decent but the battery life was mediocre at best (about 2.5 hours).
3104,"June 7, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Dope
3105,"June 7, 2020",5.0,My new AirPod,"  I do not regret paying it, 5 stars all the way"
3106,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Must have!,  These ear pods are really great!
3107,"June 7, 2020",4.0,Mic not good. Battery short life,"  I don't like battery life, very short especially during the phone calls. Mic is not good, a lot of people complain that very bad hear me. But I think this the manufacturer problem. Seller’s service good👍🏻"
3108,"June 7, 2020",1.0,no good,  Only had these for a month and the right air-pod stopped working  i never dropped them and never have had any damage towards them
3109,"June 7, 2020",2.0,Battery Does Not Last Long,"  I already have ordered a replacement once because the battery was bad an the left earbud stopped working. Now I cannot get them to connect to anything. It's been 2 months, they don't work now and I can't return them. Be careful"
3110,"June 7, 2020",1.0,"If you're considering it, don't do it",  I purchased 2 pair of these airpods on May 25th. Today is June 7th. Not even 2 weeks later they will no longer stay connected to  my nephews phone and when they are connected it sounds static like or as though he has bad reception. I took a chance buying an apple watch as well as 2 pairs of airpods and regret my decision completely. BUYER BEWARE
3111,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Apple perfection,"  They are apple AirPods, what else needs to be said? I had a knock off pair and they were big and hurt my ears. Learned my lesson for sure! Always get what you pay for and apple never lets a person down."
3112,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Just as described,"  Love them, sound is great"
3113,"June 7, 2020",1.0,Not real,  I received fake iPods not legit.  Having hard time getting my refund
3114,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Airpod Overall Review !,  Love Them!Packaging was easy to open and very protective when unboxed! I’d highly recommend them ! Theses aren’t fake airpods for those wondering these are the real apple airpods !
3115,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Apple earbuds,"  Exactly product. Have used them for quite awhile & have no issues. Sound quality is excellent, fit well in ears & easy to sink with my phone"
3116,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Genuinely Happy,  Genuine Apple Airpods bought as a Mother's Day Gift for my mom and wife. They love them!
3117,"June 7, 2020",5.0,They are real Apple,"  After seeing the fakes, I verified these are original apples by researching the model number and serial number. They are real Apple."
3118,"June 7, 2020",5.0,"This package comes quick, easy, and most importantly reliable.","  I was really scared to know I’m spending so much on headphones but once they got here I fell in love!! They came about 2 days early, great packaging, and great quality"
3119,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Quality and sound.,  The AirPods work great in all situations. I could not have desired a better quality product. Keep them coming.
3120,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Satisfied customer,"  Best one, still overpriced"
3121,"June 7, 2020",5.0,Amazing results,"  I use AirPods with iPad and Motorola phone. It’s really nice. Battery life is long, I love the quality. They are very nice. 😁👍 very smart purchase!"
3122,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Highly Recommend,"  Bought these for my husband as part of his birthday gift... y’all, he is obsessed! He literally carries them around in his pocket all day and uses them daily. Nothing bad to say at all, highly recommend & a great gift."

3125,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Excelente
3126,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Cool Product Excellent ship time,  Another Apple product to add to the collection.  Still brought the Apple care warranty.
3127,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  Battery lasted longer than i thought
3128,"June 6, 2020",1.0,TERRIBLE AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF USE,"  After 4 months of using them they stopped working, sound quality was good and is now TERRIBLE. The AirPods won’t connect to my phone anymore despite trying to restart them many times. I want a replacement."
3129,"June 6, 2020",5.0,That it’s your moneys worth !,  It’s loud and they work .
3130,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Love it
3131,"June 6, 2020",5.0,GREAT,  These are AMAZING and worth every penny. I bought myself some and my roommate some. They have incredible battery life too. 5 stars.
3132,"June 6, 2020",4.0,Life Savers .,"  I cant live without my air-pods now , theyre so convenient . Not as loud as i would love though ."
3133,"June 6, 2020",4.0,Everything it’s good,  I love this item
3134,"June 6, 2020",1.0,It does not look good,  I am not happy with theservice and the look of the delivered item. The item did not lookright. the boxes inside the package are weirdly messed up. And theitem does not look new at all. This was meant to be a gift but Itdoes not look good.
3135,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Great,  Love them!
3136,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Excelente calidad del sonido,"  Lo utilizo para todo: conversaciones telefónicas, escuchar música y oír conferencias virtuales"
3137,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Great,  Came early and are the real thing
3138,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Comfortable,  These are great. Never like previous ear phonesNo problems at all
3139,"June 6, 2020",5.0,It's lit!,"  I was very against wireless headphones, especially the airpods but I'm in LOVE with them and I've only had them for a day"
3140,"June 6, 2020",4.0,Airpods Regular vs. Airpods Pro,"  I bought the pro version three months ago and accidentally tossed them (I was drying them with tissues) so I went for the cheapest replacement (Airpods 2). Here are my thoughts as to which one to choose.If this is the only listening device you have and you care about music quality, then buy Airpods Pro (noticeably superior music quality that falls far below earphones such as Sennheiser HD599; the quality is also below that of Boss QC35II).If you use this to listen to audiobooks, or if you have better earphones for music at home, by all means go for the regular Airpods. Why? I personally find it far more comfortable. The regular airpods are like the earbuds that come with Iphones -- while not the most comfortable, wearing them for two hours is not a big problem. I found the pro version extremely uncomfortable for more than an hour. The noise cancellation is cool, very cool, but not essential for my usage.If you travel frequently on domestic/short flights, then airpods pro might be great for its noise cancellation feature. But bear in mind Pro airpods are not the most comfortable. Moreover, battery lasts about 5 hours so airpods won't be ideal for longhaul flights.What I like about both: if you have lots of Apple devices, switching across these devices is very easy (2-3 clicks/taps).So for this regular version, I rate:3/5 for music quality;4/5 for comfort;0 for noise cancellation."
3141,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Great,"  Fits well in my ears, sounds good, user friendly. Great product"
3142,"June 6, 2020",1.0,Missing item,"  Package came empty, back side was ripped open, nothing was in it"
3143,"June 6, 2020",1.0,3rd pair to stop working within 6 months!,  This is my 3rd pair that has stopped working since Christmas. The sound all of a sudden becomes so low that you can barely hear anything. I expected more from Apple. My $5 earbuds from Family Dollar has lasted longer.
3144,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Than you,  Nothing
3145,"June 6, 2020",5.0,I advise it to buy the product,  Was good still using the product
3146,"June 6, 2020",1.0,Right airpod won't charge,"  I've now returned two sets of airpods.  The exact same problem happened with each pair.  They would work for 15-30 days, and then the right airpod stopeed charging.  I returned the first pair, and they sent me a second pair.  Around 30 days later, the right airpod died and stopped charging.  I just returned that pair and requested a new pair.  I've read the same issue has been occurring when you buy these on Amazon.  If you really want a pair I would buy them directly from Apple."
3147,"June 6, 2020",5.0,AirPods good and bad,  They don’t tell you when battery is low or dead.Right one keeps falling out. Use left one more great sound  with music  I use them for when I’m sewing so I can use both of my hands.
3148,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Bang for the buck,"  This is our second pair. These are hard to beat for there size and price. A full headset has better sound and noise canceling, but will cost an additional $100."
3149,"June 6, 2020",5.0,No Brainer!,  If you own and iPhone - go with AirPods!
3150,"June 6, 2020",3.0,"i think these are really nice, knockoff airpods.","  these seem like theyre fake.. i really cant say for sure, but my 1st airpods were from target. they didnt have any flaws. the sound was better, they charged faster, they synced better, they had better range... i either got a bad batch or these are the great value brand airpods.edit- today is august 5.. the right earbud no longer takes a charge. the left no longer syncs.. i bought a new pair of airpod pros today."
3151,"June 6, 2020",1.0,No service no support!!,  Very low volume no noise canceling stopped working after two months  I’ve  made countless attempts and notified Apple support and Amazon only to be shined off.  The AirPods don’t work at all  and neither does the customer support for Amazon  And Apple. Buy directly from the Apple store and NOT through Amazon.
3152,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Great Purchase!,"  Love them, so glad I decided to purchase. They make like way more convenient in a lot of ways."
3153,"June 6, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,  Works great!! Months later still happy with my product :))
3154,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Perfect.,"  Upgraded from first gen. Connects much faster, no problems at all. Excellent sound quality."
3155,"June 5, 2020",5.0,THESE ARE THE REAL DEAL! Great buy!,  These are AUTHENTIC AirPods and the sound quality is great! Most definitely satisfied with my purchase!
3156,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Got the product I was promised,  Glad I Purchased these!!
3157,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Always do a good job,  Great package
3158,"June 5, 2020",1.0,they are not that good quality,  they are not that good quality
3159,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Yes,  Great buy. Lover these. Use all the time at work
3160,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Coolest Tech,  Simple but some of the coolest tech from Apple in a while. Syncs super fast to anything. Easy for me to switch from my Mac (Zoom Calls) to my phone. Battery life is super long. Charging the pods is so fast.
3161,"June 5, 2020",5.0,🌟,  Very good product but shipping took two days past due date to make it here!
3162,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Perfect just one concern,   I love it! The quality is so good and it’s the really thing! Exactly what I expected! Although the case seems to be a little loose and it concerns me that it might break!!
3163,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Great condition,  Love them!
3164,"June 5, 2020",5.0,So excited,  Sounds really good and an authentic Apple product
3165,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Really good,  I really like this product. Great for working out.
3166,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Love it,  I love my AirPods!! Excellent sound and very confortable.
3167,"June 5, 2020",4.0,Ease of use and reliability,  These headphones look good and fit in ear well enough. They do not create a seal around the ear. The sound is good for what it is. Compared to other headphones these are a lot easier and straightforward to connect and use with other apple products. I think its a over priced for what you get and can get better quality from others brands at similar price ranges. The time I have spent with the headphones they have proven to be reliable and easy to use and I do not regret my purchase.
3168,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Happy with the Apple Airpod!,  Very satisfied with the purchase! Good product!
3169,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Highly Recommend for Apple Users,"  Came in two days, as expected. Good sound quality and easy to connect!"
3170,"June 5, 2020",5.0,It’s real and loud,  LOVEEE JT JUST LIKE THE PICTURE LOUD AND REAL
3171,"June 5, 2020",5.0,"Long battery life, loud enough",  It's good
3172,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Worth it,"  I’ve been on the fence about investing in the AirPods, but the deal was too good to pass up on. I was worried about the fit because I have tiny ears but they fit great and don’t fall out!"
3173,"June 5, 2020",5.0,never disapoints!,  These are Great!!!!!
3174,"June 5, 2020",5.0,Good,  Just as described
3175,"June 5, 2020",1.0,Bad quality airpods,  Volume on Left AirPod  is seriously low and staticky. Lasted about a month of good quality and now I’m stuck with some broken AirPods and no support.
3176,"June 5, 2020",5.0,These are amazing !!,  These were my first Covid-19 purchase.  These are great for Zoom calls on my computer.
3177,"June 5, 2020",5.0,"Waited all these years for nothing, GREAT PRODUCT !!!","  I was very hesitant to purchase Apple Ear Buds due to the price. I waited several years because I thought they were too much money. I also didn’t think the battery life would be good. However, I was wrong. The little white box they come in is a charger, and keeps the earbuds charged all day long. As soon as I pop them in my ears, They automatically turn on by themselves.  If I wanna pause a song, I do a double tap.They’re so cool. If you have an opportunity to buy them, I very highly recommend it."
3178,"June 5, 2020",4.0,"Great Light Weight  Device, But.....","  I bought these because I had trouble keeping similar wireless headphones in my ears while walking or exercising.  Other wired or wireless headsets with interchangeable, difference sized soft ear pieces never fit right and had a tendency to come loose or slip out entirely.  Very annoying at the gym in the middle of a class or on the treadmill. These are so light and hang on the ear that you don't notice they are there.Frankly I don't use them on an 'i' device but on an Android phone.  That shouldn't matter.  The only negative is that every once in a while they seem to go out of sync.  This causes an echo effect.  It becomes difficult to understand spoken word because of the echo.  The only way I have found to fix it is to go to Bluetooth settings, disconnect, then reconnect the AirPoids.  That means I have to stop my exercise program to restart them.  Very annoying.  The connected device used shouldn't matter if the Bluetooth is compatible."
3179,"June 5, 2020",2.0,Good but hurt,  These hurt my ears so much. Other than that they were great.
3180,"June 5, 2020",5.0,awesome,  Love it! Works wonderfully!

3190,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Calidad,  La mejor inversión que
3191,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Genuine 2nd Generation AirPods,"  My AirPods were purchased directly from Apple and were shipped by Amazon, so I was expecting and received a genuine product.  I read a lot of comments regarding if these are the 2nd generation AirPods, and I was a little confused myself.  The charging case for the AirPods that I received had the indicator light on the inside of the case instead of on the outside; which is how Apple designed the first generation of AirPods.  After doing some research, this is also how Apple designed the second generation of AirPods, IF they do NOT have wireless charging.  So the only AirPods that do have the indicator on the outside of the case are the second generation, wireless charging AirPods.  After checking my products warranty on Apple's website, it confirmed that these are the 2nd generation AirPods; and also confirmed that these are real AirPods."
3192,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Great!,"  I loved them. However less than two weeks having them, lefty has gone bye bye. Avoid drains/sinks and toilets! Lol"
3193,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Y E S !!,  Yes yes yes
3194,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Good Quality,  These headphones work great and are good for work calls and pickup a lot of noise so there is no issue with hearing others on phone calls

3197,"June 4, 2020",5.0,"Happy wife, happy life.",  My wife love's them.
3198,"June 4, 2020",1.0,Not apple,  Pretty pissed that I did not get the product I paid for. These are not apple product! Trying to be passed off as apple.
3199,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Spend the money all the cheap ones don’t compare.
3200,"June 4, 2020",2.0,Care about your ears,"  I hate them, they always make your ear hurt. And they are great air pods but they are not worth being in pain for I would sell them, I had mine for 2 years"
3201,"June 4, 2020",1.0,AirPods broke,  One of them does not work
3202,"June 4, 2020",4.0,"Love the wireless, although fit is awk","  Airpods are pretty consistently great to use. Only issues are that they are not the best fit for my ears and sometimes they glitch and make a scratchy noise. Needless to say, I have thoroughly enjoyed using this product, especially for the ability to leave my phone on a table and walk around!"
3203,"June 4, 2020",5.0,They’re what I expected them to be.,  Love them!!
3204,"June 4, 2020",5.0,"Very nice, battery lasts long.","  They were very nice and the battery lasted a long time. They were also very durable, I drop mine on the ground all the time. And not a single dent."
3205,"June 4, 2020",1.0,Disappointed,  Just got my package there was nothing in the box and there was no plastic around the AirPods package no charger no nothing just a box and paper.
3206,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Works as it should
3207,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Works Great!,"  I'm an office manager so I spend a great deal of time on the phone and typing on my keyboard at the same time. The airpods work great for me! I was so tired of trying to hold my phone to my ear by leaning to one shoulder or the other, or putting my phone on speaker, which bothered my boss. Now I can talk hands free without crimping my neck or making the whole office listen to the speaker phone. Also, it works great because no one I speak to when using the airpods has to ask me to repeat myself. They can hear me loud and clear now. :-)"
3208,"June 4, 2020",2.0,Unreliable product from Amazon.,"  I had to return 3 sets of the AirPods that I ordered from Amazon. The right AirPod constantly went off after a week. My guess, you’re shipping refurbished products. I finally ordered new ones from Apple. They work just fine."
3209,"June 4, 2020",5.0,who wouldn’t love these,  My daughter loves and never takes them off. i haven’t seen her since i gave them to her. Thanks...
3210,"June 4, 2020",5.0,great product,  The Airpods work perfectly and were a good price the only thing is they can be a little uncomfortable the first few wears.

3212,"June 4, 2020",5.0,the best,  its the best air phones ever
3213,"June 4, 2020",5.0,ear buds,  love them
3214,"June 4, 2020",4.0,Good device but they need to sit in your ear just right,"  Great device, but make sure it is fitting your ear correct or they will fall out. I haven't been able to narrow down exactly what it is, but every now and then one will fall out or slip to some crazy angle. I am super careful but it will get me sometime, I am near positive. I have seen it quite a few times on planes where people fall asleep and wake up to find their ear bud gone. It happens.For being a tiny little device, they seem to do pretty well on holding power. To mitigate any real possible problems, I use the charging case whenever I can. Go to lunch, charge them for 1/2 hour. Driving home from work, charge in the truck for that time while charging the case as well.Sound seems to be pretty good. I can jack my iPhone up quite a bit and not really hear any distortion. I use these with a MPow Bluetooth adapter and I get distortion there, but I have proven it is the MPow.Rarely do I use the Airpods with my phone in a noisy condition so i don't have much to say about noise cancellation. I also rarely use the touch features minus the ""oops I just turned them off again"" accidental.One thing that is a bit annoying is in regard to the charging case. I work in an industrial environment. Somehow, that case tends to find every single metal shaving known to man. Getting it away from the magnetic pull of the case can be a real pain in the butt. I use a tiny plastic screw driver to lightly scrap it away so I don't dig into the plastic. Depending on how much you have there, This can be tedious to get out."

3218,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Great product by Apple,"  Everyone got a set of these for their birthday this year. Great technology from Apple--you can hail Siri and have her read voicemails or messages or listen to music, etc. Might have to adjust in-ear fit from time to time as they can loosen up a bit during workouts or activity. Overall though a great set of earphones."
3219,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Buena compra,  Me encanto
3220,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Wonderful!,  Actually pretty great!
3221,"June 4, 2020",3.0,There is definitely better for a lower price.,"  They were ok, they would feel loose at times, and the sound is good when it's quite but when there is other sound, it's hard to hear it, it would also disconnect quite frequently and after 30 minutes of use, they would already have a yellow light."
3222,"June 4, 2020",5.0,love them,"  real airpods , gettem"
3223,"June 4, 2020",5.0,Money well spent!,  Excellent product! No issues
3224,"June 3, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,  At first I was worried about the product. For some reason it died really quickly when I began using them. But now they last! Not sure what the issue was but glad they work!
3225,"June 3, 2020",4.0,Its different,  These are good earphones but its weird because I bought these same ones from Apple twice  before My first ones broke and i lost my second pair but this kind of seem fake?????Its hard to explain how but I know this is Apple product but it doesnt seem like the authentic Apple product

3231,"June 3, 2020",5.0,Perfect Fit,  I love these ear buds! They are the only Bluetooth wireless headphones that I have found that truly fit my ears. They don’t budge at all when I’m jogging. Well worth the amount of money!

3239,"June 3, 2020",5.0,Great gifts,  Very nice this is the third set I purchased they make great gifts.
3240,"June 3, 2020",3.0,"Good, but.","  I'm writing a honest review for this one. There're some advantages. It's convenient, looks cool, and the sound is not bad as an apple  product. BUT. They said in the description that this one contains the new H1 chip which only AirPods 2 have(which is also what I thought I got). I felt like wireless charging case is unnecessary so I got the wired charging one. And clearly they sent me the AirPods 1 since the case is different. And the reason why I can tell is the delay is the same with the ones I used before. And most importantly, I just got this yesterday and the battery is already different for these two earbuds. So I'm gonna say if you really want or it's necessary get the wireless one, that might be the 2nd generation. Otherwise it's really not worth buying, waste of money."
3241,"June 3, 2020",1.0,Nothing was in the box,  Box came empty
3242,"June 3, 2020",1.0,These don’t work - buy somewhere else,"  These only worked for one week (in January) after I ordered them.

3244,"June 3, 2020",1.0,They don't stay in your ear and keep falling,  They don't stay in your ear and can falling. So be careful because if they fall they can get damage. I bought them for my wife because she has an iphone. But I was disappointing. They could have done something better for $160. I bought another one in amazon as well for comparison and it was pretty good and only cost me $40 dollars.
3245,"June 3, 2020",2.0,Too quiet,  Right ear bud wasn’t loud at all
3246,"June 3, 2020",3.0,One Pod Not Working,"  I just received my AirPods and as I was testing out the new product, I noticed the right pod to be ineffective. Im very disappointed in the fact that I literally just unboxed these new AirPods and one is already not working. The left pod works fine and connects fine, but the right pod doesn’t produce any sound at all. At first I thought it was a connection issue. So I tried to reconnect and it connects fine to the case and only one pod. I also tried to reset my network configurations. But the issue remains."

3254,"June 3, 2020",1.0,THEY ARE FAKE. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE.,"  I looked at this, seeing ""apple"" is the seller and I looked at reviews and was skeptical but I tried. That was my first mistake. I'm pretty sure people are paid or given some benefits to write false reviews, but don't believe these people here. These airpods are NOT genuine. They are not REAL AIRPODS. They're 100% 3rd party, the quality sounds like you're under water.. Save yourself and grab it somewhere else, PLEASE."
3255,"June 3, 2020",5.0,Wonderful!,"  My brother ordered me one and it works so well! I was afraid of possibility receiving a fake one because people said they have gotten a fake one in the reviews, but I’m so glad I got a legit one hehe. Now I can do things freely and I don’t have to worry about how the heck I’m going to charge my phone if I’m using the wire headphones. No more struggle."

I have tried everything from disconnecting and reconnecting, turning off ear detect, disconnecting all other Bluetooth devices, and many more...  nothing helps.

3264,"June 2, 2020",5.0,AWESOME,  Just as described
3265,"June 2, 2020",5.0,Very convenient and worth the price!,"  These were packaged very well and had no damage to the box, product, or any of the accessories included. The battery has a strong hold once fully charged (about 4+ hours of listening time until a charge is needed) also on the bright side, they get a full charge in under 25 minutes. The airpods also fit very well in my ears and I almost never have problems with them falling out unless I don’t adjust for a long period of time. The sound quality is very good and sounds AMAZING with certain songs. (They come with the airpods already in charging case, a cable to charge the case and a manual for extra guidance). Overall, i’m very happy to have purchased this item and I think its safe to say, its definitely worth the price!"
3266,"June 2, 2020",5.0,highly recommended!,  got them today and absolutely love them! these are the authentic airpods and have verified that they are :) they work excellent and bought a few silicone protectors for it (sold separately). these are the second generation airpods (2019) so they are very much new. airpods have a life expectancy of around 2-3 years so they are well worth the price!

3272,"June 2, 2020",2.0,Sound quality sucks over a month...,"  I have been using almost a month. And the sound quality is getting worse. Dusts are everywhere, and sometimes the battery life drains faster. It turned into a complete piece of crap.... i wasted my money..."

3274,"June 2, 2020",1.0,"Does not work properly, big waste of money on an expensive item",  Can not get any information online or apple to help us figure out why only one of the ear buds work. We tried the obvious by cleaning it and trying to charge it again. Resetting it doesn't work and now our time to return it has passed.
3275,"June 2, 2020",5.0,Great product!,  How did I make it before I got these?  Sound is excellent. All the other things going on around me just melts away.  It does eventually hurt one small place on my ear.  That’s to be expected since I’m putting hard plastic with no give in my ear.  I’ll soon figure out how to wear it comfortably.

I told them I couldn't return them during the pandemic and they told me they would NOT make an acceptation. How can I return and item when the WORLD is closed because of a pandemic, seriously!!!! This is crap I deserve my money back!!!! I asked for a supervisor and they told me they were busy!!!!!!"
3284,"June 2, 2020",1.0,These were used,  These worked well for about a month.  Now they are extremely muffled when I am talking to someone and they can't understand me at all.  I reached out to Apple for help and learned that these were NOT brand new (as they were supposed to be).

3295,"June 2, 2020",3.0,It’s just ok,"  It’s an ok bluetooth earphone. Sound quality is just ok and they keep falling out. Paring was very easy, but a lot of times, I have to repair when I switch the devices. Very disappointed."
3296,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Worked perfect with my phone .
3297,"June 1, 2020",2.0,Not sure if this was a good investment,  Overall i have really enjoyed my airpods but have only had them for a couple months. Sound quality is pretty decent. Noise cancellation isn’t noticeable but then again these are not designed for noise cancellation so I Wasn’t really expecting that aspect. I gave noise cancellation 2 stars in case someone might be looking for that. Battery life is as expected and there isn’t a complaint there. Here’s my main complaint and I consider it a big one. For the first couple weeks i have really enjoyed the AirPods and used them for hands free calling. Within the last week people have started complaining they cannot hear me very well while speaking on the phone. I have tried adjusting the position of the buds in case the mic wasn’t close to my mouth and I have tried cleaning them but things haven’t improved. Here’s the kick in the teeth...yesterday was the last day for me to return them through Amazon. I’m currently waiting to speak with apple.
3298,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Exactly as advertised,  Exactly as advertised
3299,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Comfortable,  So comfortable. I have small ears and these fit the best by far.Worth the extra money!
3300,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Good sound,  Perfect
3301,"June 1, 2020",5.0,great,"  bro these was fire. and they’re REAL. the sound is pretty cool, this is my first pair so i’m learning about all the features and stuff but really cool!!"
3302,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Easy to use and quality sound.,  High quality.  Easy to use and excellent sound. Very satisfied!
3303,"June 1, 2020",1.0,Not happy with these AirPods.,  These AirPods were a Christmas gift for my 15 year old daughter. They worked great at first but by May the AirPods would not charge at all. The return period expired in January. Now I will have to take them to an Apple store. Not impressed
3304,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Quality material!,  I love the sound quality 100%. It’s much better then the wired airpods
3305,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Perfect AirPods,"  These AirPods arrived in perfect condition. New, sealed box with instructions, charging cable, charging case, and of course, the AirPods! I don’t know why the other reviews are a mixed bag of poor to terrible so far as the product is concerned. You can tell from my pictures that there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. I don’t think these are intended for noise canceling, so I rated them a 3 in that area. Otherwise, 5 stars! The AirPods and charging case arrived more than 75% charged, too. Ready to go right out of the box. Love them!"
3306,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Sounds good,  My daughter love ❤️ Her gift.. The sound is awesome...
3307,"June 1, 2020",5.0,It’s aight!,  Can still hear ppl over the sound of I only have 1 headphone in. Other than that it’s good.
3308,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Perfect
3309,"June 1, 2020",4.0,High quality sound and fast charging,"  Whether you're charging the case, or you're using the case to charge the pods, it's VERY fast. They sound excellent, and they're easy to set up on iPod, Apple Watch or iPhone - you can use them on Apple TV or even non-Apple cell phone.  They tend to last about 4 hours for me on a full charge, and the microphone is NOT as good as a wired Apple headphone, but they're light in the ears and very comfortable."
3310,"June 1, 2020",5.0,these are great,  so amazing literally best headphones
3311,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Real AirPods and very good sound quality,  These are real so the people that are saying it’s fake are lying and if your thinking about getting these get them they’re worth it trust me 💯
3312,"June 1, 2020",3.0,Love Hate Relationship,"  I'm fully in the Apple Ecosystem: iPhone, iPad, Mac. It was time to replace my wireless headphones and heard so much about the Airpods and so many friends love them, decided to stay Apple.  Indeed Airpods work great with Apple products. If that's all you're going to use them for, don't hesitate. I've bought and returned 3 other airbud products. Primary issue was the device staying in the ear, then sound quality.  Airpods stay in your ears and the sound is very good for the price point.HOWEVER........I'm primarily interested in wireless help with hearing especially my TVs.  I do not have Apple TV. One TV is a smart Samsung with Bluetooth and the other is Panasonic that I've added a Bluetooth transmitter.  Anything that's not Apple has no issue pairing with the TVs.  When it comes to pairing the Airpods, my blood pressure rises each time. Sometimes they pair, sometimes not.  But that's not the real issue.  The Airpods do not have independent sound control. If you're using an Apple device, you control the sound through the device like phone, watch etc.  However, my TVs (two major brands) do not have volume control for output. Very few TVs do.  So if the volume is too high or too low, I need to disconnect from the TV, pair with an Apple device, get the volume where I think I want it, then disconnect, then re-pair with the TV and hope the volume is somewhere near where I like it.I spoke with Apple about this and their response is buy an Apple TV device. That way the Airpod will pair and sound can be controlled. In my case, I would need to buy 2 Apple TV devices.  The low priced airbuds come with volume control, apparently there isn't any technology magic required.  Apple is choosing to not include.I'm still undecided about returning the Airpods. The fit, comfort and sound are well worth the price. The volume annoyance is a reminder each time I use these things that Apple is not the customer focused/design company we think they are.  Before I bought the Airpods, I spoke with 3 friends who use and highly recommend.  Each one told me I would be able to control the volume with my iPhone or iPad. After talking with Apple, that is not the case.While on that subject, since my last Apple purchase this is the first time in about 18 months that I've needed to talk with Apple support.  What has happened over there?  Four calls in two weeks; each time I feel like I'm speaking with someone that is just reading a script and doesn't really understand the issue.  The solution to most any issue seems to be, buy something else Apple.  As a long time shareholder who's gone through a lot of stock splits, I appreciate the focus on Apple products but come on, there's more solutions to improving an Apple product than buying another Apple product."
3313,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  I bought these for my niece's birthday 8 months ago and they are still working perfectly.
3314,"June 1, 2020",1.0,Not authentic AirPods,  The ones I received were fake. Do your due diligence and check upon receipt.
3315,"June 1, 2020",5.0,When your Grandbaby is an APPLE Snob,  You MUST buy the air pods.  HE LOVES THEM!! And that is all that matters to me
3316,"June 1, 2020",2.0,Wont charge,  I got these in Feb. and its May 15th and they wont charge?? Pretty upsetting!! Didnt last 6 months.
3317,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Love the AirPods the work wonderful
3318,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Super fast delivery,"  Works great, love them! Came literally the next morning after buying the evening before! Amazing!"
3319,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Awesome to not be tied down with a phone cord!,  Shipping was fast and they were easy to pair with my phone and work computer. Have been using them all morning and really enjoy not having a cord to work around. Definitely recommend!
3320,"June 1, 2020",1.0,Didn’t last 60 days,  Not working after 60 days. Purchased the additional warranty.  Going to try to deal with that.

3323,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  I love them!
3324,"June 1, 2020",5.0,Son orijinales,  Exelente compra
3325,"June 1, 2020",5.0,My son wears them everywhere he goes!,"  My son bought these with his own money! He loves them and carries them everywhere. He says the sound quality is awesome, and they can prevent him from hearing me (if you know what I mean LOL). Also, when I am next to him, I cannot hear how loud they are in his ears, that's awesome as well. Overall a great buy, delivered right on time!"
3326,"June 1, 2020",3.0,Price is a SCAM BY APPLE,  Great product but please don’t buy it at the current price. The sound quality is up to par with any other 30-40$ ear buds/head phones. It also falls out when you try to run with it. It’s so easy to fall out and disappear. Poof 150$ gone. The charging case is really not 150$ worth of innovation. The highest I would pay for the entire thing is 60$ Now that I have it.
3327,"May 31, 2020",3.0,Loved them! But the battery life sucks,"  I was promised a certain amount of battery life on these, and it wasn't delivered. One of them only lasts a little over an hour. The other only a couple hours. Just got them 4 days ago and already have to exchange them for the pro version- hopefully those will be worth the hefty price tag."
3328,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  No flaws and came in the mail perfectly

3332,"May 31, 2020",4.0,Love love love,"  Amazing, it works so good I love them, but they hurt the ears after a while ."
3333,"May 31, 2020",1.0,Made to break.,  My AirPods stopped working after less than 6 months.  No support from Amazon or Apple.  Find something else.
3334,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Highly recommend to get one!,  I love these airpods because they are so small and so convenient to carry around without the wires. Definitely love it!
3335,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Great product,  My son was very happy with the ear pods.

3338,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Good for light use,  Using this for my conference calls at home. They work great.
3339,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Great deal on thes Genuine Airpods 1st Generation.,"  Love my airpods. I always love apple products because of their high quality products and commitment to customers likings. And even better because as always Amazon has great deals. Although these are the Airpods One not the 2, i honestly cant tell much of a difference as they are fantastic to me."
3340,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Good,  Good
3341,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Recommend,  Very pleased Thank you
3342,"May 31, 2020",3.0,Confusing,  I used it for two days and after that the left one stopped working and reset it and done everything I can. But my iPhone stopped accepting my AirPods so I can’t use it or know if it works
3343,"May 31, 2020",4.0,Kids love these!,  Good product. Kids love them!
3344,"May 31, 2020",3.0,Good.,"  Prefer these to the Samsung buds, even with an Android. Sometimes the mic gets super quiet, or stops working if I get one call after another. But overall, I like them."
3345,"May 31, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Perfect work
3346,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Amazing earbuds,"  I love them, they are absolutely amazing"
3347,"May 30, 2020",1.0,Not good,  Not good at all! Mine broke 3 days later

3349,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Good quality and works perfect,  Love it
3350,"May 30, 2020",2.0,Product does not last and has poor sound quality.,"  Initially we liked them, however, my daughter has always complained that they don't get very loud. I am constantly turning telling her to turn them down because they are very loud from the outside. She was constantly telling me I can hardly hear them from the inside. We were driving home from school one day and after tired of my getting on her she said, ""Here, I'll prove it to you."" She put one in my ear and she was right. They are louder from the outside than they are from the inside."
3351,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Hello perfect headphones,  These are perfect for what I needed! Battery life is good. I’ve always wanted these and I love them!
3352,"May 30, 2020",1.0,Problem pairing,  The right one wouldn’t pair 👎🏽 Very disappointed! Was so excited about these.
3353,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Not a fan of Apple..until now,"  I am the only one in my family that is still uses Android. My work phone is Apple and I hate it. However the wired headphones that come with the phone are used continuously even on my Android. I got tired of getting the wires caught on everything so I finally bought these. Omg what was I waiting for?! I am super picky about earbuds and I bought this older version because they are the same as wired. I know I wouldn't like the pro version. Anyway, the sound quality is amazing, even better than the wired. I forget they are in my ears. Pairing them with my Android was super easy. Love them and worth every penny!"
3354,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Oh yeah !!!,"  I can hear you now, BETTER and with STYLE !!!!"
3355,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Worth every penny,  I like that this product came in a very timely fashion. Within a week of ordering. They are super great & feel great. It’s very useful for working out and washing dishes without any strings in the way
3356,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Good,  As described
3357,"May 30, 2020",2.0,Not great quality,  The airpods constantly slide out of my ears making them difficult and frustrating to wear. Constantly pushing them back in or scared i’m going to lose them. Can hear all backround noises. Volume does not go very high
3358,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Awesome purchase,  So far I love them! Shipping and delivery were super fast!
3359,"May 30, 2020",5.0,satisfied,  just as described.

3361,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Great Product!,  I have had these for 5 months and love them.  Great quality!
3362,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Good,  Very nice
3363,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Best fit,"  I have small ear canals and the Apple earbuds are the only ones that fit perfectly. They may fall out after a while if you jog or run but I got some fins to keep them in place and a strap. Also, I don't like noise cancellation especially when I'm outside so these still provide good sound quality while allowing you to hear ambient noises.I only wished they had better battery life."
3364,"May 30, 2020",4.0,Fácil uso,  Muy buen producto
3365,"May 30, 2020",1.0,Empty box!,  I was so disappointed to open the box to find only the charging cable and No AirPods!
3366,"May 30, 2020",5.0,Great gift for wife,"  AirPods were a gift to my wife. As soon as she opened up the AirPods, the AirPods sync to her phone and popped up with her name. She loves them, uses them for work mainly. AirPods have the ability to stop sound when you remove one earbud from you without having to touch your phone. This gift doesn’t come with a charging cord for it, my wife uses her iPhone charger to charge the AirPods. Would recommend this as a gift for your spouse for any occasion."
3367,"May 30, 2020",1.0,Feeling scammed..,"  Caution: these are not the same quality AirPods. Other Apple devices only recognize it 50% the time, L headphone charge drains within an hour, randomly disconnect during workouts. I’ve owned AirPods from work, these are not it."
3368,"May 30, 2020",4.0,Great,  Great
3369,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Works Great,  Quality product and they work great.
3370,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Use them daily,  Love these pods! Use them all the time especially for work. Helps with driving as well
3371,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Works just like the ones we got from apple
3372,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Sturdy,  Love my new purchase!
3373,"May 29, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Very happy with the product REAL AIRPODS !!!
3374,"May 29, 2020",5.0,It's an Apple product what's to say?,"  It's an Apple product, and like all Apple products its very beautifully and nicely packaged, and for the most part works very good.  And, like all Apple products they are manufactured by China for pennies on the dollar, and then Apple marks up the price by a thousand percent, and passes that very expensive price to US customers. Nothing more needs to be said about Apple products and business practices in the US, and support for foreign labor, instead of US labor. And, don't forget the Apple Care they would love for you to get, that strangely always seems to expire just a few days before your product gives out. It's like if they install a Mission Imposible ""this item will self destruct in 5 sec"" destruct switch inside your item to go off a few days before your Apple care expires."
3375,"May 29, 2020",5.0,My son loves these,  Bought these for my son. He loves them and uses them every day.
3376,"May 29, 2020",5.0,On the Fence?,"  I was on the fence for quite awhile about whether I needed these as I own everything Apple, but I held back and that was a mistake! Apple quality SHINES once again! Everything about these is exactly as you would expect from Apple, you really do get what you pay for! I am very pleased with the airpods, I am enjoying them as I write this review, the sound is absolutely excellent! I had zero issues setting them up with my Iphone. The quality in craftsmanship and quality is pure Apple, The sound is amazingly excellent! They are comfortable to wear. I have not tried any heavy duty physical activity with them on but I'm sure there are other reviews here that cover that. I waited too long! The price is reasonable for something that will give you many years of pleasure!"
3377,"May 29, 2020",1.0,They did not work,"  Could not be more disappointed. They did not work, opened new out of the box, the green light is on, they will not pair to any device. Tried to refresh, they do not work out of the box. What a bummer"
3378,"May 29, 2020",5.0,LOVE AIRPODS!,"  I absolutely loveee these AirPods!  I was a little hesitant because it’s Amazon, but the company is Apple directly themselves if I’mnot mistaken. I’ve had them since early April and they’re working well, I haven’t found any issues. I bought the regular charging case, not wireless. It charges well, I haven’t found a battery issue. Given we’re living that quarantine life (written from New York by the city In May 2020 lol) I haven’t gotten much of a chance to try them out for a full day out traveling. But I’m confident I won’t find an issue even then. They work great! The sound goes LOUD! I’ve heard with certain wireless headphones they don’t go too loud to keep from damaging peoples ears, my friends don’t like it though because they don’t even get the option of raising it louder if they wanted to. Honestly these AirPods are worth it. I can’t see what difference there would be buying them directly from an Apple website vs Amazon, it says they’re from Apple. I have no reason to believe otherwise since they work well. An Apple protection plan is offered too. Which I got, because I’m accident prone! It was worth the total price I spent, I’m very happy with my purchase. They’re so useful! If you’re thinking of getting AirPods, buying them here from Amazon is a purchase you shouldn’t regret, the price is good and the product is good!"
3379,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Very good,  Good
3380,"May 29, 2020",5.0,3 Cheers for AirPods,"  I bought these for my sister-in-law who is an Apple Fan and she loves them. She loves the sound quality, design, fix, and compatibility with her iPhone."
3381,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Most importantly the sound is amazing and it’s good thank you,  I use this product for my iPhone i love it its litt 🔥🔥
3382,"May 29, 2020",1.0,DO NOT BUY,"  I bought these from amazon warehouse. They were advertised to have a minor cosmetic issue (like a scratch or knick) but fully function properly. When I opened them, I nearly threw up. They are CAKED with ear wax and you can’t hear hardly anything out of them. I am very disappointed with my purchase."
3383,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Great product,"  Work great! Pairs strait to iPhone, only thing I disliked is the battery life, but other than that wonderful product! Money will spent!"
3384,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Sound quality,  Love quality of sound
3385,"May 29, 2020",1.0,"Waste of money, just get regular Bluetooth earbuds",  My daughter saved up to buy these and the sound became tinny and distorted after 2 months of use even though she was very careful with them. Don’t waste your money!!
3386,"May 29, 2020",1.0,Buy directly from Apple,  Was refurbished AirPods
3387,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Great purchase!,  These are awesome!
3388,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Great sound!,  My wife loves the new headphones!
3389,"May 29, 2020",5.0,Good,  They were I gift for my teenage daughter and she loves them. So easy to pair with her phone.
3390,"May 29, 2020",4.0,Great for normal ear holes,  AirPods need no reviews. I’m just leaving this one to say that if you have small ear holes (is that a thing that has a real name?) they fall out after a bit. They aren’t the most comfortable and apparently look a little weird in my ears (according to my daughter who laughs every time she sees me with them) because the stick out due to the way I have to wear them. So... love them but would be nice if they came in smaller sizes for those of us who are ear hole challenged.
3391,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Excellent earbuds!,"  Purchased these for my teenage son and he loves them! The charge lasts great, my son wears them every waking moment. These are simple to use and very durable. I’m so happy with my purchase."
3392,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  I was a little worried to buy these because they weren't straight from the Apple Store, but they are great! No complaints!"
3393,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Okay,  Good I guess
3394,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Real Apple Airpods,"  Great, original product. I love the sound, and it’s super durable."
3395,"May 28, 2020",3.0,"Bought two, one is fake",  Bought a pair a month ago. Worked great for 2-3 weeks. Started having connection issues and stopped turning off when they were taken out of my ears. Just received my replacement today. Kept first pair to compare. They are both different!!! Sold and shipped by Amazon yet the AirPod cases are not exactly the same size. Which one is fake?
3396,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Worth it!,  Soo amazing! I can’t believe these are the real deal!
3397,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Good Airpods,  They are great
3398,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Great product!,  I didn't know i needed AirPods until I got them. Very satisfied with this purchase. I've been using it for about 5 months. My only complaint is that the case is easy to scratch.
3399,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Love them
3400,"May 28, 2020",1.0,Gross unboxing,"  When I opened the box there was hair inside, and earwax on the airpods"
3401,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  The volume so  clear .Great buy
3402,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Great.,"   I got these about 1.5 months ago as a replacement for my previous AirPods I lost.  They’re still working pretty well. Only issue is that it sometimes goes in and out when I’m watching a video like on Netflix or YouTube. It doesn’t disconnect from the Bluetooth, but it sounds like someone breaking up on the phone. I just have to take them out and put them back in my ear but it’s still annoying. The attached photos and the video are recent. These were NOT captured right after I opened the package."
3403,"May 28, 2020",5.0,sounds good!,  the case charges about as fast as a phone but the headphones inside the case charge super quick! love them
3404,"May 28, 2020",1.0,New or Used?,"  i recently bought a “new” pair of airpods, i received them with the box itself damaged and dirty, been tampered with and clearly these are *USED* airpods, they are very dirty and have scratches on them itself. very disappointed, i decided to get prime and try out shopping apple products. my first time doing and probably my last. better if i just go in person to the apple store myself."
3405,"May 28, 2020",3.0,Sound and hearing,  Very unsatisfied... air pods would echo and have a lot of static sound.. also battery did not last long. I’m returning and replace with abort her por hopefully the second pair works better.
3406,"May 28, 2020",5.0,love them,  My new favorite thing . Battery lasts for many many hours.
3407,"May 28, 2020",4.0,"works well with non apple products, too.",  I hate apple but for some reason they're the only company that design ear buds that don't fall out of my ears. Good sound quality when paired to my pc and android phone.  I'm sure they have Apple only features but they work great as a generic Bluetooth headset as well.
3408,"May 28, 2020",5.0,The only way I am getting through quarantine,"  I used to believe that AirPods were for douches, who like to look important, but they are so convenient.  I can clean my home and listen to an audible book or walk around the grocery store, looking like a crazy person talking to myself.  It helps me stay sane because of how well it keeps me from hearing most of my kids' arguments about who shot who in the face with a nerf gun and who needs to clean more of the room.  Thanks, Apple, for keeping life interesting."
3409,"May 28, 2020",5.0,🍎👍💯,  It is Apple 🍎!! Good product!! Worth to buy! Shipping was fast too!
3410,"May 28, 2020",1.0,I received an empty box.,"  The UPS man just left my drive way, and when I opened the AirPod box, it was empty. No AirPods no charger!"
3411,"May 28, 2020",5.0,No more fumbling with wires,"  You wont be disappointed! I had bought aftermarket airpods and I literally threw that thing in the garbage. To be free of wires when you’re working, keep your conversations private without using the speaker on blast - is a great feeling! The Bluetooth connection is instant. Sound quality is better than wire headphones."
3412,"May 28, 2020",5.0,real airpods,  They are really great but they took a while to get here because of the pandemic but other than that i would recommend these 💗
3413,"May 28, 2020",1.0,Damaged product,  My product is damaged. It seems as if there is some sort of shortage after the first week of usage. There is black soot in the case and a brownish discoloration as if it was burning. I will not use because I am uncertain of its safety. Please help!!
3414,"May 28, 2020",5.0,New Apple Licensed Product,"  New enough to have arrived with 85% charge. Super easy set up for both my iPhone 6s's, Mini iPads and Apple Watch Gen3. I appreciate the fact that it has great sound quality without having to jam it into your ear. Unlike other brands, I have yet to notice any conversation delay on calls."
3415,"May 28, 2020",2.0,Not good in the long run.,"  Had 6 months and now no longer hold a charge, stay connected, and the right one won’t even work. Very disappointed."
3416,"May 28, 2020",1.0,Keeps disconnecting,  I bought this 5 months ago and unfortunately one of the airs keeps disconnecting while I’m listening to a music! & it’s too late to return or replace the device!
3417,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Still a better deal than Air Pro 2,  It's Apple and a must-have for iPhone users. Ideal for taking calls. Voice quality is good.
3418,"May 28, 2020",5.0,good,  Good
3419,"May 28, 2020",3.0,uses it daily.,  shipped a day early and nice product. would recommend it.
3420,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Great airpods,  Great AirPods. My son wears them all the time.
3421,"May 28, 2020",4.0,Good sound but need better battery life,"  The sound is good, no noise cancellation at all, I wish the battery life lasted longer while in use the case stays charged for a couple days so I think that’s a good feature but the head phones themselves need more battery life"
3422,"May 28, 2020",4.0,First time Apple user,"  I have been using the airpods for about a month now, and I am a first time Apple product userI have purchased less expensive airpods/earbuds and these are the best by farShipping was fast, and packaging was in tactConnectivity: I have an android phone, and connecting the airpods to my nonapple product was super easySound: When making and receiving phone calls, the sound quality was good. Way better than the other 3 earbud brands I own.  There was no choppiness, no computerized sound and the other party/myself did not sound like we were at a distance. Music and video sound was crispDistance: I live in an apartment. So I was able to leave my cell phone in room A, and go to rooms B and C without losing connection. I also was able to go outside without losing connectionBattery life: Kind of short. If you're on a 5+ hour road trip or flight, you'll have to recharge your pods. Overall, 5 hours is not badFit: They don't fall out of my ears. Also, It's more comfortable to use headphones for extended amounts of time. Only because there is no cushion on the airpodsThe  charging dock for the airpods is small and compact. I usually keep it connected to my laptop to keep it chargedOverall the apple airpods are worth the price, and I do recommend this product"
3423,"May 28, 2020",5.0,Exactly as advertised!,  Love them!!!! Just like new and I have had no troubles
3424,"May 28, 2020",5.0,They are real,  Perfect
3425,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Great buy!!,  They are my first pair and definitely worth the price.
3426,"May 27, 2020",5.0,LOVE JUST BUY THEM,"  Y'all! I’m obsessed with these AirPods! Im a mom with 3 kids. These come in super handy when ya gotta multi task and take calls! Makes all the difference when working out and there is not cord or phone that needs to stay attached to you. They work great. Super comfortable, and don’t fall out your ears. Just get them. For the price point, it’s so worth it. Once you go wireless you’ll wonder how you ever lived without!"
3427,"May 27, 2020",5.0,AirPods! Amazing!,  Amazing! Absolutely love them!
3428,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Love them!,"  I got a great deal on these and they work perfectly. Haven’t had a problem yet and I’ve owned them for over a year now. Would def recommend! Set up is easy and they’re so sleek and convenient to use, especially while charging your phone."

3430,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Air pods,  Daughter loves them
3431,"May 27, 2020",4.0,Eeeh they’re OKAY,"   Well, for one thing, they’re uncomfortable. It’s literally putting plastic in your ear, and it hurts at first. Other than that, the battery life is even longer than my phone! The sound quality is okay, but I recommend other brands. Charges really fast, I’m excited to use these further on!"
3432,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  I love them
3433,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Genuine Apple Air Pods!,"  Genuine Apple product purchased for my Son, we pretty much already knew how they'd work sound etc since my oldest already has them. Definitely would purchase from seller again!"

3435,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Works great
3436,"May 27, 2020",5.0,love them,  i was kinda nervous to order these after reading the reviews but i wasn’t disappointed one bit. came in brand new and i even checked the serial number on apple’s website to check if they’re real or not. don’t regret buying these and would high key recommend these to others (:
3437,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Worth the buy,  Battery lasts a long time and it’s nice not having any cords
3438,"May 27, 2020",1.0,Connectivity Is Spotty then shortly after it is nonexistent,"  I bought these about a week ago and I immediately ran into problems. The volume seems to be limited ( I can clearly hear people speaking even with volume maxed out) , bass is nonexistent, and If I spend about an hour listening ill have 8-10 episodes of connectivity disruption, which will consist of either voices going in and out of hearing or complete disconnection. Ill look at my Bluetooth settings on my phone and my phone will say the connection is fine. The volume is lame and I've honestly gotten better Bluetooth connections from $20 best buy specials. I'm very disappointed and I'm out $160.00 DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!!"
3439,"May 27, 2020",5.0,I love it🥰,  I like how when I got it it was fully charged including the case and it had came in really fast. The sound of the AirPods were loud and I truly recommend this item.
3440,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Brand new and Overall Great,  It’s great! Great sound quality and microphone works amazing! Fully boxed and wrapped box!
3441,"May 27, 2020",2.0,People can’t hear me well while on the phone,"  I never give a negative review on Amazon, but the AirPods aren’t working well. I can hear clearly but people can’t hear me well."
3442,"May 27, 2020",5.0,It’s an apple item,  I love it
3443,"May 27, 2020",5.0,These are NOT fake.,  I am annoyed at the multiple people who said these AirPods were fake. It almost stopped me from getting them. These are the real deal and one of my favorite things I’ve ever bought. I also bought the extra Apple care coverage just in case. These are a great product.
3444,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Money well spent,  It was a gift for my granddaughters and they are completely satisfied with their quality and performance.
3445,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Awesome sound quality and good battery,"  Got these as a gift for my boyfriend he loves them! Much better then he expected, and don't fall out and are super comfortable! The sound is amazing, he wears them all day while working (construction) and they last about 5 hours non stop usage before getting to low battery and are fully charged in about a half hour"
3446,"May 27, 2020",4.0,Wish I had splurged for the Pros,"  They do get a little sore in my ears after a while. I wish the battery lasted just a smidge longer. I generally use them while doing things around the house, and they will last a few hours. The sound quality is very good. The input quality is better than the standard corded ear buds. It picks up my voice better. Noise cancellation is comparable to the standard ear buds.My biggest complaint is that these were not clean when I received them. I opted for the open box to get a discount on these. The description indicated that the box may have been opened and possibly damaged. However, it did not indicate that the item had been previously used. And especially considering the current pandemic situation, particular care should have been taken to ensure that the item had been cleaned. I spent about 20 minutes scraping ear wax out of the ear buds! Gross! And if you have had any Apple ear bud before, you know that it is very difficult to get into all of those tiny little crevices! I sincerely wish that Amazon had taken a little more care in the processing of returns such as this!"
3447,"May 27, 2020",2.0,Not the best quality,"  Used it twice & now it won’t charge. First time I pulled it out to use them, one of the pods came apart in my hand & I had to put it back together"

3449,"May 27, 2020",5.0,A gift for my 16 year old,  They were a gift for my daughter she loves them
3450,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Item as described.  Great product,  Was bought as a gift for my son.  Great product.  Item was as described and fast shipping.  It’s been 5 months now and it still working fine.
3451,"May 27, 2020",5.0,Good,"  It was a good buy, Apple AirPods with Charging Case"
3452,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Voice problem,  Hello Guys. The problem with my AirPods is while windy whether the B side can't hear me properly and there is an unknown voice on the line and as a consequence I can't use airpods and talk in windy whether. I had an airpods before this (first generation) and didn't face such problems at all.
3453,"May 26, 2020",5.0,As shown,  As shown in the description and picture
3454,"May 26, 2020",3.0,Meh,"  Eh, I sort of regret buying these. They slip out the ear quite easily and are just awkwardly designed. I recommend buying the beats or something else if your ears don’t still well with earbuds. These are not even remotely flexible."
3455,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Amazing — but batteries could last longer.,  I love my airpods. I just wish their batteries lasted longer.
3456,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Real apple product!
3457,"May 26, 2020",1.0,WHERES THE OTHER AIRPOD????,  When I got my AirPods it came perfectly boxed and everything but I was missing the right AirPod
3458,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Original.,   I bought these for my sister and I was a bit skeptical but she loves them and I am so happy they are worth every penny. Original too. Absolutely LOVE!
3459,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Cute.,  This is so cute. I read a lot of reviews and I nearly got disappointed but I must say this is super cute. Everything is new. Forget about the negative review and get yourself one. I recommend these.
3460,"May 26, 2020",1.0,New headphones came used and covered in ear wax,"  My mom surprised me with “new” AirPods for my birthday, but what arrived was clearly used and not even cleaned. The case is sort of tarnished, but that’s the least of my issues. These came covered in little black hairs and ear wax. So grossed out. I’ll be returning these and buying straight from the Apple store!"
3461,"May 26, 2020",1.0,Voice quality not good,  This product was not the one how it was advertised for . Right side piece was not able to connect at all.Left side device was able to connect but the voice quality on the remote end was terrible .We finally gave up and returned it .
3462,"May 26, 2020",5.0,"Fantastic product, easy to use and well worth the price",  Love these! Pushed off getting them for a couple years but I’m so happy to have them now. I previously had wireless BeatsX earbuds and these are much better.
3463,"May 26, 2020",5.0,calidad-precio.,  muy util y comodos
3464,"May 26, 2020",4.0,Good,  overall for the prize they are good
3465,"May 26, 2020",5.0,"Skeptical at first, they're the best!","  Truthfully, I waited a very long time to buy AirPods. I was concerned with their battery life, their ability to fall out of my ears, and especially their price. When I purchased the headphone jack-less iPhone 8 though, I knew it was time to switch.I love them! Their battery life is very impressive and you can charge just the case which is super cool. I didn't think the increased range of mobility would be that big of a deal, but it is so convenient to be able to have a greater range of motion while running. I can even cook and clean very easily all with music and not worrying about being attached to a phone. After trying them, they do feel pretty secure in my ears. Also, the sound quality is immaculate compared to my previous 20 dollar corded headphones. I'm going to college next year so I'm super excited ill be able to have complete focus even if others are making noise. My music is so clear!For all my skeptics out there, if you can afford them of course, they are a great purchase! I recommend."
3466,"May 26, 2020",4.0,Love the Airpods,"  Compared to my earbuds that came with the phone, no comparison. I love the AirPods!"
3467,"May 26, 2020",1.0,Fake. Fake. Fake. Apple says the serial number has been used many times.,  These are fake. Not true Apple product. Same serial number used many times. Found out by calling Apple support bc of a problem!!!!
3468,"May 26, 2020",2.0,AIRPODS 1st gen.,  The first one came with connections issuesThe replacements came in fast no issues there2 seconds later another 160$went bye bye from my account.I return both I’m not sure why they came in with issues.
3469,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  These are great the battery life is awesome I’ve charged them once since I got them.
3470,"May 26, 2020",5.0,They are real,  They are authentic don’t worry about what the others say just listen to me don’t worry

3474,"May 26, 2020",1.0,No llegaron los 3 airpods que compre',  Se recibieron solo 2 airpods y compré 3.  Por favor necesito que se pongan en contacto con el teléfono que aparece en la dirección para que solucionen el problema lo más pronto posible y envíen el artículo que falta (1 airpod)
3475,"May 26, 2020",1.0,No product,  I received my order today with an empty box only the charging cable!!!
3476,"May 26, 2020",3.0,Pros and cons,"  Pros:  I like the sound and noise reduction. I also like being able to recharge them in their case. They connected to my devices easily.  Cons: They hurt my ears, I am afraid of them popping out and losing them, and they lose their charge fairly quickly. Not sure they were worth the money."
3477,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Can’t go wrong with AirPods!,"  These fit better in my ear than the Airpod Pros! Great deal, these aren’t the 2nd gen AirPods but I rarely use wireless charging. Just got them in the mail and put them in and they are more comfortable in my ears than the pros."
3478,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Stay In my Tiny ears,"  I have had trouble with other earbuds falling out of my ears, but these manage to stay in even on my runs. Only complaint is that I sometimes pause or skip a song when I adjust them, but that may be user error."
3479,"May 26, 2020",5.0,Good deal,  I bought this AirPods in an offer and it was a good decision!
3480,"May 26, 2020",4.0,Good device,  I sometimes have issues with the Bluetooth connecting but that’s usually when I overcharge it. Otherwise... it’s pretty good to use
3481,"May 26, 2020",1.0,only worked for 2 months,"  bought item in february and it doesnt work already , the worst ."
3482,"May 26, 2020",3.0,"entire package did arrive,but They wont stay in my ear.","  AT first I thought I was missing the earphones,I found them in the box,but I cant get them to stay in my ear."
3483,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Good stuff
3484,"May 25, 2020",1.0,"Were great, until they suddenly stopped working","  Had the airpods for 4 months and they were amazing. Sound quality was great, felt very comfortable, the whole nine yards. I loved these earbuds. After 4 months, without warning it just stopped working. It connects to my Samsung phone, but it doesn't play any sound. Ok weird, I'll just put it back in the case and take it out again (disconnect then reconnect). Still the same issue. Try to unpair the earbuds and pair them back and still nothing. Put the earbuds in the case and held the button to reset it until it gets that amber light and still nothing. I then thought ok maybe it's because I'm not using an iPhone, so I get my old IPhone 6 and try to connect it to that and see if it fixes it and what do ya know nothing. I kept resetting it so many times and I finally got one earbud to play sound. Right earbud plays sound and left one doesn't, ok cool progress. I tried resetting it a couple more times and now the left one plays sound but the right one doesn't. Continued resetting it and now the right earbud plays sound but the left one doesn't. It sucks, but at least I can still use one earbud. I'll continue to try and see if I can get both ear buds to work and if I do I'll update this review, but until then It's a 1 star for me :/"
3485,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  Great sound!
3486,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Good headphones,"  Honestly some of my favorite headphones. I love being able to put cases on the charging case. However, if you want noise canceling headphones these are not for you. They do not block out sounds very well. For me I like being able to hear my surroundings so I like not total sound cancelation. The battery life is really good. I only charge the case every other month. Very good purchase."
3487,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Buy them,"  I love my AirPods. I definitely use them on a daily basis. Exercising, driving, or to watch videos. The only thing I can’t do is run in them because they fall out my ear ."
3488,"May 25, 2020",1.0,Right AirPod doesn't work,  AirPods don’t even work on right side

3490,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Love my AirPods!,  This is a great product!
3491,"May 25, 2020",4.0,could be better,  one of the airpods was filled with earwax. i get that it’s refurbished but you could at least clean it

3494,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Would recommend,  These work amazing. I use mine everyday at work hardly have to charge them due to the charging case
3495,"May 25, 2020",5.0,THESE ARE OFFICIAL,  Works just as good as the wired and as loud just wireless versions came brand new and with a lightning fast charging cable it came literally in a day ordered it yesterday night
3496,"May 25, 2020",1.0,EMPTY BOX,  Received package today with no AirPods inside the AirPod box.
3497,"May 25, 2020",5.0,AirPods 2 has a lot more feature than the first AirPods,  I like the way how the second generation AirPods improved than the first generation AirPods
3498,"May 25, 2020",5.0,The BEST earbuds available anywhere!,"  Literally the best purchase I’ve ever made. I avoided these for so long thinking they are not worth their cost, but THEY REALLY ARE. I am an almost-daily runner and wear earbuds a lot around the house as well. I’ve had these about a week and they have never once fallen out of my ear. They’re so comfortable I can’t feel them in my ears for hours at a time. The sound quality is fantastic and they pair and unpair to your phone or watch automatically, every time!! So so so happy I gave in and bought these."
3499,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Why did it take me so long to buy these,  Absolutely love!!! They are the best headphones hands down.
3500,"May 25, 2020",2.0,Nay,"  It’s very nice, not noise canceling but I didn’t expect that..Update: I literally wrote the review immediately after getting them. And wearing them for 2 mins.They die super fast, and I’m not sure if it’s my ear shape or what but they fall out all the time! I’m so disappointed."
3501,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Christmas present for my granddaughter and she loved them
3502,"May 25, 2020",5.0,great,"  sound quality is nice, it charges really fast."
3503,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Great Quality,  My duaghter was si excited for these The shipping was the very next day and They quality is Terrific and so easy to use ❤
3504,"May 25, 2020",5.0,I didn’t know what I was missing!,  It took an extra week to receive but I finally got my new AirPods!  I like how they quickly pick up the Bluetooth and the sound quality on my many conference calls is excellent!  I am also enjoying the Siri feature. Only odd thing is they want to play music from my iTunes I don’t cue up.
3505,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Great Sound,  I bought these for my daughters as graduation gifts. They absolutely love them. Now I need to get a pair.
3506,"May 25, 2020",5.0,Best gift!,  Got it as a gift for my best friend.  She loved it :)
3507,"May 24, 2020",5.0,The best,  Better than the pros for simple reasons
3508,"May 24, 2020",1.0,Stopped working after 4 months.,  Bought 2 pairs one for me and one for husband...  Both are 4 months old and the quality are terrible.  I1 pair  Stopped working Within 2 months . Keep cutting out and drop cutting out. . Huge disappointment. The other pair is for me and never fit in my air or stayed in!
3509,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Must have for apple users,"  I am an apple fan, and the airpods is a no brainer when it comes to wireless earphones if you adopted the apple ecosystem. I really like the feature where it auto connects to your apple device when taken out and also it remembers which apple device you last listen to and connects to that. Also the auto pausing feature it has just puts it way ahead of other competitors. And not to forget the image upgrade it brings to the person wearing it. Definitely a buy!"
3510,"May 24, 2020",5.0,As described,  As described
3511,"May 24, 2020",1.0,They Suck,  They suck and keep disconnecting.
3512,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Nice pair of headphones,"  It took me a while to get on the AirPod wagon but it’s a nice product to have. I have a pair of wire noise cancelling headphones but need can’t walk around as easy. These headphones allow me to walk at least 10 feet from my phone and still be able to hear/answer a question. They do fall out of hears every once in a while, so I probably wouldn’t use the for jogging or any other high intensity activity, but they are perfect for zoom meetings and listen to music while doing other tasks."
3513,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Used them today and loved them
3514,"May 24, 2020",5.0,The quality is awesome 😎,"  Omg these Apple AirPods are awesome I like how they pause my music when I take them out of my ears , the sound is spectacular and they automatically paired to my phone when took them out of the box I’m so excited.. I had some big bulky fake ones from boost mobile and they were sooo TRASH !!!!! And these were also delivered on time as promised"
3515,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Great product,"  Worth it.  So much better than slightly cheaper alternatives for working remotely, video conferencing, and watching video."

3519,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Amazing Sound Quality!!,"  Finally came around and ordered these AirPods. Love them!! Sound quality is amazing!! Setting them up took less than 15 seconds! Yes, 15 seconds!!! Took them out, my iPhone immediately recognized them and connected, and I was ready to go! Highly recommend these!!!!!!!"
3520,"May 24, 2020",5.0,trabaja muy bien,  Excelente
3521,"May 24, 2020",1.0,Very Poor Connection Quality,"  Go buy these from an actual Apple Store or Best Buy is my advice. These have worked for me about 40% of the time, connection was terrible and they wouldn't hold a charge. I doubt they are the actual Airpods 2 since I'm reading other people's review on this and based on the experience I had with them. Will be returning."
3522,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Great Product,  I use the AirPods everyday to listen to good music while I walk.

3531,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Great!,  I have had no problem with mine. Battery life is great. No static like the regular cheap kind I used to buy. I love them.
3532,"May 24, 2020",5.0,Ideal Earphones for iPhone,"  It’s definitely the go-to headphones when it comes to convenience, call quality and battery life. Especially if you have an iPhone it would be hard to beat unless you go for the Pro Version. If you’re looking for noise-cancellation look elsewhere, otherwise these are the best earphones to buy!"
3533,"May 23, 2020",5.0,It's great!,  Love it
3534,"May 23, 2020",5.0,In perfect condition,  These AirPods came in good condition and it was completely sealed as if I had purchased them from apple or best buy. They connect right away and everything sounds perfect.
3535,"May 23, 2020",5.0,amazing,"  amazing, great sound and they charge SO FAST"
3536,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Use a alcohol wipe instead of washer and dryer!,"  Great headphones! Sound quality is good, but why I am writing this review is the durability. My boyfriend gave me them outside when it started raining so they would not get wet. Well, I forgot them in my pocket and they went through the washer and dryer. To our surprise, they charged fine and no issues with sound quality or call clarity.- Fin"
3537,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Love these!,  Great buy and price.
3538,"May 23, 2020",5.0,The very best in Sound,  I’ve attempted multiple headphones and ear buds without success and a colleague suggested I try the Apple earbuds and I’m simply amazed and so grateful for his advice. These are the best sound and connection to my iPhone...thank you!!
3539,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Great product,  This product is very easy to use and great to listen to music.
3540,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Earbuds,  Got here in 2 days.  Easy to operate.  Great product as advertised. Great sound.
3541,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Worth the cost !,  Totally Worth all the money !
3542,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Great,  Love
3543,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Grateful,  Thank you ! ❤️
3544,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Works great!,  Just as described.
3545,"May 23, 2020",1.0,Won't Connect,  I received my product on time. That's the only good thing. I Was not able to sync to my i phone or iPad. They just kept blinking amber then white. I spoke with Apple to get help with the issue they were not able to assist in getting them to PAIR. I will be returning.
3546,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Sound quality,  Awesome sound quality
3547,"May 23, 2020",1.0,only one ear piece would work,"  very difficult to get this to pair with an iPhone.  when it finally did pair, only one of the ear pieces would work.  Went online for help, nothing available worked.  Amazon terrible return policy in jumping through hoops to get returned.  Amazon misdelivered the first set and blamed me for losing the item and suggested that I walk my neighborhood asking people if they received my package in error."
3548,"May 23, 2020",5.0,Its Apple!,"  Wireless, effortless, magical"
3549,"May 23, 2020",5.0,They are very loud😍,  Great product I’m very satisfied ❤️🥰
3550,"May 23, 2020",5.0,The perfect tool for WFH,"  Day 2 of my WFH experience I realized I needed wireless audio capability to be more effective on video and audio teleconferences.  With meetings usually lasting one hour, and my schedule often having back-to-back meetings, it would be nice if the battery life were a little longer than the 3 hours. However, understanding that batteries add weight, and current technology is what it is, I'll go with bluetooth airpods any day! Just remember to park them in the recharger module between meetings so you don't have to switch to wired audio. These also work well when you're WFH with a significant other and you both need your own professional space, even if in an apartment."
3551,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Great sound!,  They work really good! I recommend this product.
3552,"May 22, 2020",5.0,They Came quick,  There great my friend loves them go ahead order from this vendor there great
3553,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Great sound,"  Great sound quality. However, the battery does not seem to last all day. Also the pods can accumulate lint, which obliterates and sound and has to be removed with a brush. I bought and use the OXO Good Grips Electronic Cleaning Brush."
3554,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Apple quality.,  Love it.. worth the purchase.
3555,"May 22, 2020",5.0,They stopped working without much use.,  We barely used them and they stopped working after 4 months. I would like them replaced if possible.
3556,"May 22, 2020",1.0,Empty box delivered,  My order was just delivered and it was a Empty box like someone opened it and closed it back. I’m very upset this was for my daughter birthday gift tomorrow and now what. Can someone please contact me
3557,"May 22, 2020",5.0,satisfied,"  the delivery time, i love it. thank you!"
3558,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Worth the money for sure
3559,"May 22, 2020",3.0,Battery life in question,"  I really wanted to like these and in many ways I do. They sound good. But I don’t think I’ll like them for long. I just charged them for the 3rd time. They were plugged in, in the case, for 2 days and only charged to 91%. A 9% loss in a few weeks is a lot. So I guess I won’t be liking these for too long."
3560,"May 22, 2020",3.0,Ouch,"  These hurt my ears sooooo bad. I have small ears, but I’ve never had any other headphones that go in my hears hurt like this. They are so uncomfortable I basically have to force myself to wear them. That said every other feature they advertise is dead on."
3561,"May 22, 2020",5.0,The best,  I love them so much they works great with calls and music too great  buy
3562,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Great sound quality,  Awesome easy to use
3563,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Stop buying something trying to get these...,  I have tried to avoid spending the money for Airpods and then I broke down after a pair I bought weren't loud enough to cover the music being played at my gym.  I bought these and really couldn't be happier.  They fit well and are loud enough where I can play what I want to listen to without hearing other music.  I also noticed I was able to walk a pretty good distance away from my phone without issue there as well which is nice!  I wish I would have broken down prior and just spent the money.
3564,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Brand New,  As described
3565,"May 22, 2020",5.0,High quality,"  Very satisfied with this item, bought it for my daughter's birthday. Sound and design are excellent."
3566,"May 22, 2020",3.0,Features are good but not very reliable,"  When the AirPods are working, they work great! However, there have been so many times when one headphone doesn't work despite my phone showing both being fully charged. I end up having to reset the AirPods every time this happens, which happens quite often, making them very annoying to use."
3567,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Better than expected.
3568,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Finally in the loop,"  Apple's headphone design is the only design that I am able to wear for extended period of time.  So when I was able to afford the AirPods, I bought them.  They are great."
3569,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Love these!,"  I had to purchase these after my previous cord ear buds went out. Was reluctant because of the price. But they are proving to be worth every penny! The sound quality is amazing. If I get a phone call, even when outside and I have these in I can hear the caller very clearly and have been told my voice is very clear coming through. Highly recommend these!"
3570,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Nice,  As far as I know these are the real air pods.They work great.
3571,"May 22, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Love it
3572,"May 22, 2020",1.0,My AirPod where missing,  So when I opened my amazon box I found my  AirPod box already open with only a charger wire super mad about it
3573,"May 22, 2020",5.0,—,  I love them! They charge fast and last quite a while. They are authentic if anyone is wondering it came in the original box and with everything inside.
3574,"May 22, 2020",5.0,No headline 🤣,  Great product. Love Apple & amazon 💓
3575,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Amazing!!!!,  Apple products never fail to amaze me. These are great!
3576,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Awesome,"  I love them , make having corded head phones seem so old and inconvenient ."
3577,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Good stuff on apples part,"  Came brand new amazon tried delivering them at 4am for some reason?? But they sound great, loud as hell, pretty good price! Just be careful as when I finally got the box it wasn’t secured at all just the sealed box inside the cardboard box no packing peanuts or the abomination knows as the unpopable bubble wrap. 9/10"
3578,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Great,  Love them
3579,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Buenísimo,  Buen trabajo
3580,"May 21, 2020",3.0,how do I return the airpods,"  I am very disappointed with the airpods. they have terrible battery life and don't keep the charge. I would like to return them.for the amount of money i spent, I am very disappointed"
3581,"May 21, 2020",4.0,Good but expensive,"  I’m an Apple guy but after losing one of my ear buds, I purchased a $40 pair and I will never pay $150 for ear buds again.  Not that this is a bad pair but the difference between this $150 pair and a $40 pair is negligible."
3582,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Best,  Best
3583,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Great for the apple enthusiast,"  My wife wanted overpriced apple earbuds..pardon me airpods, and these were a tolerable price point. Great functions and decent mic pickup though i will admit."
3584,"May 21, 2020",5.0,My kiddos love them!!,"  Bought 2 pairs for my kiddos. They absolutely love them!! My son did say, he wished they had a longer battery life."
3585,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Worth the hype,"  Super easy to use and toggle between my iPhone and MacBook. Comfortable, good sound and mic quality. Worth the investment"
3586,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Great product!,  I love the AirPods so far. They have great sound obviously they are cordless so that’s great not having a cord in your way while working out or taking a jog.
3587,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Everything was wonderful,  Wonderful😄
3588,"May 21, 2020",1.0,New out of box and didn't work.,  Bought these new and the right AirPod didn't work.  Returned next day.
3589,"May 21, 2020",5.0,I love my airpods,  I love my airpods! Brand new in case! The real apple brand!
3590,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Took too long to arrive,  Great product. It took 9 days for this to arrive which was way too long. I bought these as a gift for my wife and I had a hard time stalling. I get the whole convid 19 thing but geez.
3591,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Doesn’t stick to the ear - Waste of Money,"  The quality of the sound is great, but it’s not recommended if you are planning to use it for running. In my very 3rd time running using it the right pod fell from my ear direct under my feet and didn’t resist. Very fragile. Wish I had bought the new model."
3592,"May 21, 2020",4.0,Works extraordinary for  small ears,  Excellent battery life. Best in the class but design is flawed which makes it fall off sometimes. Works for small ears
3593,"May 21, 2020",5.0,I received them,  There dope
3594,"May 21, 2020",2.0,Meh,  They were good and then they started acting up when I tried to call someone
3595,"May 21, 2020",4.0,Pretty good,  Sound quality is good but not nearly as good as a set of headphones. Good for working out and day to day activities.
3596,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Range Sucks,"  Let me start this review by saying that I'm using these pods with a Blackberry Priv that has an Android OS, so take that FWIW.  Maybe they aren't compatible, or optimally compatible, or whatever since they're an Apple device.  I don't know, but the point of having them is to be able to listen to my phone without wires, and they don't allow that very well.The range is limited, like less than a few feet, and depending on where I'm using them it's less than that.  For example, I can be at the gym on an incline bench, set my phone on the floor next to me, and the podcast that I'm listening to cuts out. Maybe there's interference from the gym's piped in music - they work well enough when they're about 10 inches away from me in the rack on the elliptical machine.This afternoon I was washing my car in my garage.  When I was washing the tires I left the phone on the hood of the car, and when I went to wash the rear tires, my podcast cut out.  I ended up turning them off them and using the speaker in the phone.The only time these pods really work is when I'm driving and I have my phone on my lap.  YMMV depending on how, when, and where you use them."
3597,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Is not original AirPod from Apple,  Wasn’t the original AirPod from Apple and it says in  here is from Apple but is not it looks China to me
3598,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Love love love,  I love these. I attempted to buy some knock offs on Amazon several months ago and they didn’t work at all. These are amazing (my first pair) and I love everything about them.
3599,"May 21, 2020",1.0,"Poor quality, inferior product","  Bought this product late Jan. At first, it worked fine. Later, only one of the ear buds works. Worse investment I’ve made."
3600,"May 21, 2020",1.0,F This,  THE BOX WAS EMPTY.
3601,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Reliable,  Great
3602,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Super excited!,"   Great purchase! I’ve been wanting these for a long time, so great to have them now!"
3603,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy! Its work less than 1 year!,  Less than 1 year its stopes work!
3604,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Highly recommended,  I wanted these for a very long time just never had the money and my bf bought them for me. Made me so happy
3605,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Worth the price.,  It’s a really great product and great for noise cancellation with excellent sound quality.
3606,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Amazing Sound Quality but Some Cons,"  Update: I've had these for six months and the case has stopped charging. They are essentially useless now. I would recommend purchasing through Apple so you can get another pair if yours malfunctions. Since I purchased on here and the return window is closed, I cannot get another pair, which means $130 down the drain.This was definitely one of my best Amazon purchases. The sound quality on these is amazing even during phone calls. The charging case holds an impressive amount of charge so I only need to recharge it once every 2-3 days, which isn't very much considering I use these 8-10 hours a day.at work. That being said, there are some cons to these. The battery life of the AirPods themselves isn't the best-- you'll get 1-2 hours max. Now, five minutes in the charging case will get these back to full charge, so take that with a grain of salt. The biggest con for me has been the Bluetooth connectivity. I have an IPhone 11 so I would expect these to have no issues with connecting. However, every few times I use these, one or both of the AirPods does not connect when I pull it out of the case. It usually takes about five minutes to figure out the problem and re-connect them. It's definitely a problem when I'm trying to pick up a call on my AirPods or listen to something quickly. For that reason, I'd give these 4/5 stars. They're still worth the purchase but I'd recommend adding AppleCare so you can get a replacement if you have the same issues. (P.S. If you have an Apple watch, these do not connect independently to the Apple Watch, you will need to have your IPhone on you.)"
3607,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Received a week before I was supposed to!
3608,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Scam,"  don’t trust it they scammed me ,only gave me a charger not the air pods ."
3609,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Fast Shipping Great Price,  Son loves these. they are awsome
3610,"May 21, 2020",5.0,great,"  great product,  nice charging capabilities and holds a charge"
3611,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Nice item
3612,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Extremely pleased with my purchase.,"  I bought these for myself, it was my birthday gift. The quarantine just started and I couldn’t leave my home and I really wanted AirPods. The price was right and they came in perfect condition. I use them everyday! This is the best birthday first I have ever purchased! I will buy from this seller again. Thank you!"
3613,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Probably refurbished - bad quality / lot of issues,  Probably refurbished -1. Initially I noticed the case didn’t have a smooth click but chose to ignore2. But slowly so many issues kept coming back that includes that *battery life is very low*3. Now half the time they *don’t connect to my phone*4. Or if they connect *I don’t hear anything*
3614,"May 21, 2020",1.0,Made in Communist China,  Did not like that it is made in Communist China
3615,"May 21, 2020",4.0,"Eh, apple products are so overrated.","  Works good so far. Bought them to use for online classes to use with my android. The tapping part isnt really all that sensitive, and my hair will rip the buds out of my ears, so I have to keep putting it up to use."
3616,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Love them!👍🏻😊,  I bought then for my daughters one at a time (4 ) then me then my mom for mothers day. We’re all happy👍🏻😊
3617,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Yes,  I Love these I can’t go anywhere without them!!! The battery life start going down after a few months of having them but before then they were perfect! Sound is clear and it doesn’t feel like anything is on your Ear is the nice part! Just pay attention to a lil breeze because tht means they may have dropped out!
3618,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Can’t live without,"  The real deal. I really can’t live without these to be honest. Beside my phone and wallet, these are the main things I need whenever I leave the house. I am doing things by myself a lot and I am a person with feels at ease when I go out in public listening to my own music or a podcast. A game changer for sure."
3619,"May 21, 2020",5.0,Durable with good quality,  Even dropped on the floor carelessly for many times，still work well，it's worthy of the price.
3620,"May 21, 2020",2.0,Sucked,"  I was very excited to get these air pods and when I got em, everything seemed fine for the fist week. On the second week of having them The left one stopped working?! I took really good care of them so there were no reason for that happening. And the case was a little funky when it first arrived too."
3621,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Excellent Connectivity,"  I have several sets of wireless earbuds, and I noticed that each set worked best at different tasks. One pair would work well for music another for videos, but no set I had would do well at both. I was hesitant to purchase these because I was worried that they would have the same problem, but they work great at everything I use them for. The only problem I have with them is that they are so comfortable that I forget that I’m wearing them until they run out of battery, which is faster than I would like but quite adequate for my use."
3622,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Great Gift,  My son enjoys this product. It’s been five months with no problems.
3623,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Great gift!,  Bought these for my mom and she loved them! They work great and are perfect for everyday use.
3624,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Happy customer,"  They are exactly what they are supposed to be. Easy to use, good sound quality and convenient to take on the go. Use one or both depending on the need."
3625,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Survived full washer cycle!,  I forgot to remove them from my pocket after my run today. Later found them on the bottom of the washer (without the charging case). I knew they were not waterproof...Let them dry for 12 hours hoping they might work. And they did!!! Working as if nothing happened! Amazing!
3626,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Guess I wasn’t as lucky as others.,"  Took the chance on these bc of all the great reviews and I love all my Apple products. That being said, I feel like I got faulty AirPods. I love them ... when they actually work. I’ll get a call and put them in my ears but it won’t work every time. Sometimes I’ll get a clicking in my ear when I’m on a call or when I’m listening to music. I can’t exactly buy another pair so I’m stuck with these. Just a disappointment."
3627,"May 20, 2020",5.0,perfect,  my son love it
3628,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Authentic,  Good product
3629,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Love them!,  N/A
3630,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Great,  100% authentic I ordered these and got them the same day
3631,"May 20, 2020",5.0,THEY ARE GREAT!,  These are amazing and they charge really fast and the battery lasts you a while unless you are constantly making phone calls or listening to music. But overall the battery lasts you a long time.
3632,"May 20, 2020",2.0,Quality goes downhill,"  The airpods are nice at first but the quality goes down pretty fast. Overtime they have gotten quieter and quieter, you can barely hear anything out of the left headphone. They often glitch and make a lot static noise and won’t play the actual music."
3633,"May 20, 2020",1.0,Need back my earplugs,  Someone stole the earplugs  from the package
3634,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Definitely will buy again,"  Works just like AirPods, stay charged, love the sounds, very loud, I use them all the time"
3635,"May 20, 2020",5.0,love it,  came early very good
3636,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Loved these,  Works awsome!
3637,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Love mine,"  Don't listen to the haters, these are the real thing and they aren't used either."
3638,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Super Good Quality Headphones,"  Came in a nice package, very quickly. Neat and slick design of the headphones. Do not fall out when exercising, good sound quality, connect supper quickly to my IPhone 8! Overall epic product and I recommend it to people who don’t have wireless headphones yet! T"
3639,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Quality item,  Great product
3640,"May 20, 2020",5.0,User friendly,"  The best thing I liked is the ease of pairing process with my iPhone. It did not require any passwords or any extra steps. I just tapped the settings and the AirPods menu popped up. The quality of the sound, connection has been high as expected."
3641,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  THERE 100% real and perfect
3642,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Best headphones I've ever owned,"  I didn't really want to get AirPods, but I ruined my Bose sound-sport free wireless by leaving them out in the rain. I got these and didn't expect the sound quality to be so good! Not noise canceling, but they don't claim that. It's hard to hear sounds around you when you turn them up a bit, but the quality of sounds is so good! They were a bit uncomfortable in my ears at first, but then I learned you don't push them in as much and let them sit in the contours of your ears. They don't fall out at all, which was surprising, even when I run. My favorite feature is that they pause my music when I remove one. I think they're probably the best headphones I've ever had and I'm sad I took this long to order a pair! I'd highly recommend to anyone!"
3643,"May 20, 2020",1.0,Returned Defective Item,  I  returned defective item to Greenbrier Hub in Chesapeake Virginia.  I have email that I returned item.  It has been two weeks and I am now getting emails that my account will be charged due to not returning item that I returned.Unable to speak to anyone to explain the problem.
3644,"May 20, 2020",5.0,Ipods Changed our Life,"  My teen son for some reason loves to listen to his iPhone on LOUD! while we as a family are watching tv.These have changed our lives, thanks APPLE"
3645,"May 20, 2020",1.0,"Plastic, fake, non-Apple feeling",  Fake feeling. Lighter and more plastic than my previous Gen1 AirPods. Returned and refund went fast.Opposite to a normal Apple experience.

3648,"May 20, 2020",1.0,Bummed.,  Battery doesn’t last and the right one flew out of my ear while on a jog and exploded into 1839 pieces.Not worth the money.

3654,"May 20, 2020",1.0,Disappointed,  It was evident that I was sent refurbished ear pods. The right side did not work and when activated someone else’s name appeared on my phone.
3655,"May 20, 2020",5.0,These are such a great investment!,  I have had these going on 3 months now and I love everything about them. They were easy to connect and they are very convenient when it comes to multitasking while talking on the phone! I can't see myself ever using regular headphones again!
3656,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Absolutely love them,"  Best pair of headphones I’ve ever bought with no cords lightweight exceptional sound exceptional bass just with adequate battery life, track changing with a double tap excellent noise cancellation"
3657,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Best invention ever!,  Love these. My teenage son told me these were a must and he was right!
3658,"May 19, 2020",4.0,Great hand free listening.,  Product works well. Battery life could be longer.
3659,"May 19, 2020",1.0,Not *NEW*,  I purchased these under the guise of them being New and genuine from Apple. Since the Apple link is iN the tittle for the product. The AirPods I received are refurbished. Apple won’t help me at all. Amazon tells me to contact Apple.
3660,"May 19, 2020",3.0,Over rated Apple airpods,  They are just ok.  Apple products are overprice for what you get.  I wish the battery life was better and it had better noise isolation.  There is a lot of sound bleed and other people can hear what I am listening to when my volume is up.
3661,"May 19, 2020",1.0,Empty box,  Got my airpods and NOTHING is in the box
3662,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Everyone needs it,  My second pair.
3663,"May 19, 2020",1.0,Earwax in airpods,  Airpods came in a box with the parts scattered everywhere and both airpods have earwax in them.
3664,"May 19, 2020",5.0,PEOPLE MUTERS,  DONT LIKE TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE .
3665,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Loved them,  She loved them
3666,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Brand new untouched unsealed!,  Perfect in sealed unopened brand new Apple AirPod box. Works and sounds great! And fast shipping!
3667,"May 19, 2020",1.0,These are NOT new.,"  Apparently they once belonged to someone named Pesi or something. They arrived outside the Apple box inside the Amazon box without any popcorn or bubblewrap. Also someone took out the apple stickers. They work fine I guess, but these are not new."
3668,"May 19, 2020",5.0,not bad,  not bad
3669,"May 19, 2020",5.0,10/10 Recommend This Product!,"  10/10 recommend this product! Before I got this I was scared because there was some bad reviews, but I’m so glad I still got it! The good reviews our way the bad one for a reason, these AirPods are 100% real and they sound amazing, I’m so glad I got them!!"
3670,"May 19, 2020",5.0,no cord,  You can go through out our home listing to what ever you like and have the phone in one place and receive the broad cast. They work great.
3671,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Best purchase so far,"  These Airpods came in brand new as expected. I got these for my girlfriend since she got me some so I had to return the favor haha. They have an amazing sound quality and they connect to your phone almost right away. It’s a little more difficult for people like me who only use one side most of the time since sometimes they won’t catch that it’s in your ear but they’re still great products.The charging speed of Airpods is INSANE, you can fully charge them in like 30 minutes. When your Airpods die you can put them in the case and they’ll get charged most of the way in like 10 minutes and they still last a long time before having to charge them."
3672,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Good!,"  These are great! If you’re looking for noise cancellation these aren’t it though. They work great, but if someone else is on the phone next to you, you will hear them no matter how loud you make your earbuds. These aren’t for noise cancellation they pros are."
3673,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Awesome!!!,  The sound is amazing and when talking on the phone I can be heard clearly. These are really great head phones. About 3 hours talk time and pairs with Apple or android devices.
3674,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Worth the price!,  Love apple products and these did not disappoint. Great sound quality and came very fast!
3675,"May 19, 2020",5.0,It’s easy with the connection,  I love these they are the best
3676,"May 19, 2020",2.0,10 bugs stuff,"  if you donot care the sound quality, this is the one to buy."
3677,"May 19, 2020",1.0,Sound is Great. They Really Hurt & Fall Out Often!,"  Disappointed. I wanted to love these AirPods. The sound is perfect. Zero complaints with the sound quality. However, these really hurt. They should not cause you pain. When I say hurt, it is truly painful! This is not a mild discomfort. I tried to ignore it the first day, but after a few tries it is miserable. I tried barely placing them in my ear and adjusting it, it relieved some of the pain pressure but it still hurt. They keep falling out too!! So if you adjust it to barely go into your ear, hopefully you are not moving around and working out because these will fall out repeatedly disrupting your workout. I am so surprised at how badly these AirPods have turned out to be. They are expensive! If I had known, I never would have spent this much money. I saw others using them and just thought they would be great. THEY CAUSE PAIN AND FALL OUT REPEATEDLY. You would think that someone could design something better. I need to find something better! No sound is worth all of this suffering. My ears and head hurt hours after I remove these. Yes, it causes headaches. It’s so sad, because they have terrific sound and they look cool too. This is a BIG disappointment. My advice: Do NOT waste your money."
3678,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Please credit to my original charge card which is American Express ending 5000. Thanks,  Bought by mistake
3679,"May 19, 2020",1.0,Disappointed and frustrated,"  I keep trying to like these but I can’tI’m so disappointedThey won’t keep a charge and it’s so frustrating to charge them, then on my walk one may work but the other won’tNot sure what to do"
3680,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Great!,  I liked the packaging and it was easy to connect.
3681,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Great!,  This is a weird thing to comment but they shipped them in a HUGE box when the actual box is tiny and it’s such a waste. But they’re perfect!
3682,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Good,  I love them serves it purpose. It can’t cancel out noise that much but if u put the volume up you won’t hear a thing besides what you are listening to.
3683,"May 19, 2020",5.0,Awesome Earbuds with charging case!,  My son loves these things.  I'm not an Apple product person but he absolutely loves them.
3684,"May 19, 2020",5.0,"The End all, Be all of wireless buds","  Listening to Bowie on Spotify Now. I’ve been burned twice by those “other” uncomfortable, tinny sounding buds. I should know better. Go with Apple. Superior sound, bass. Comfortable in the ear. Trust me. These are the best out there."
3685,"May 18, 2020",5.0,GREAT product,  I don’t give a lot of 5 star ratings - and I’m not a big Apple fan - but this is an incredible product. Took like a minute to get them working out of the box and I’m not good with tech. One of my favorite things I’ve bought in a long time.
3686,"May 18, 2020",5.0,IPHONE AIRPODS,"  I bought the I PHONE Airpods for my granddaughter, she had a Iphone and had been asking for the cordless airpods for awhile, so finally after much discussion with the granddaughter about reponsibility etc...decided that she could have a pair. She absolutely was surprised when she received them, and loves them, takes very good care of them and enjoys them every chance she get. Very good product and would highly recommend."
3687,"May 18, 2020",1.0,Quit working,  Had for a week and one pod won’t work at all
3688,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Worth it !!!,  Honestly after reading the reviews I was kinda scared to order a pair but Damnn I love mine!!! Works perfect and they are real. Next time I have some money I might upgrade to the pros.

3690,"May 18, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  Me encantaron. Llegaron a tiempo Gracias!
3691,"May 18, 2020",1.0,Company not responding to me....,  My daughter bought these with her money in January. They just stopped working for no reason at all. We have tried to reach the company because it does come with a year warranty and still haven't heard back from them. Absolutely ridiculous!

3693,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Great product,  My daughter loves these. The sound quality is very good.
3694,"May 18, 2020",3.0,"No Noise cancellation, fall out easily","  1. You can hear the noise around you, which is annoying when you’re at loud places.2. The earbuds fall out during high intensity work outs.... it always feels like they are not in a secure position."

3696,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Highly recommended,  Came earlier than I expected!!! Love the sound!!!

3701,"May 18, 2020",1.0,NO AIRPODS IN BOX,"  I was so excited to open it up, but when I opened it, THERE ARE NO AIRPODS! Only the charging cable!! I’m very pissed"
3702,"May 18, 2020",5.0,They work great,"  It's a typical apple product, over priced, short battery life but they work so well that you keep buying more of their stuff. Overall they work great. Fast shipping."
3703,"May 18, 2020",4.0,Buy them,"  The AirPods is probably one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. I’ve always said that its just the EarPods but wireless but that was an overstatement. It’s literally the greatest innovation Apple came out with. But let’s get through the meat and potatoes these headphones let you go far without static, and easy song control. But my favorite feature is using Siri to play my songs on shuffle. With all the info I provide above I think you should give Apple a chance, because these headphones is lit."
3704,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  The Apple AirPods work great wonderful sound and great fit.
3705,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Love my AirPods,  My son got these AirPods for Christmas. We are very pleased! They even survived 30 minutes submerged in a pool and still worked!
3706,"May 18, 2020",5.0,"Buy them, do it!",  They are amazing
3707,"May 18, 2020",4.0,Amazing quality!,  10/10Been using them all the time and they have amazing battery life and now that I am getting a new phone with no earbud port I can just use my AirPods. Super easy setup as well!I do not like the fact that the case it's self is hard to clean.
3708,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  I brought these for my son's 13th birthday and they were great. The sound is good and when I put them on I hardly hear anything else.
3709,"May 18, 2020",3.0,Sound/connection cuts off and on,"  Overall pretty good, but definitely not up to the quality I was expecting from Apple... the sound cuts in and out frequently as I'm out walking. Even returned them for a replacement, and the same thing still happens."
3710,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Great battery life. Came brand new. I love these.
3711,"May 18, 2020",5.0,Worth your money duh,"  Its Apple, what can I say... NEW OBVIOUSLY OBSESSION! Best quarantine purchase"

3715,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Amazing !!,  i’ve been considering purchasing AirPods for a while and bought there while they were on sale and i LOVE them. 100% worth the money.

3717,"May 17, 2020",5.0,5 stars thanks,  Very happy with them great job
3718,"May 17, 2020",4.0,Good,  I like it
3719,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Yes you should get AirPods,"  These are the first pair of AirPods I’ve ever owned. I really like them, they sound great and they shipped quick. This really is work the buy, when I had headphones with wires it would get caught on everything and get in the way. Now I can workout and walk freely and they never fall out. It just sucks cause sometimes I forget to charge them."
3720,"May 17, 2020",5.0,5* to everything,  the very first apple product i own and  love it.

3727,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Best purchase.,"  Love love love!! These were a replacement for my lost AirPods while traveling. I was concerned about these being real, but they are. I love them and use these AirPods everyday! Especially with all the calls during quarantine."
3728,"May 17, 2020",4.0,Great buy!,"  Loveeee!!!Update: about 3 days later I notice a spot on the back of the AirPods case that looks as if the paint has rubbed off but was repainted with a darker color (see photo, right above thumb), I hadn’t noticed this until yesterday! I’m starting to question if they are the real Apple AirPods because of the other reviews. They work well, but they are cheaper than the ones on the apple website and I want to know why"
3729,"May 17, 2020",5.0,I love my new AirPods,  I love my AirPods they’re great when my house is very loud and I just want to be alone.
3730,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Love these AirPods and they work so well
3731,"May 17, 2020",2.0,Not worth it!!,"  I should never have purchased these. My airpods disconnect every 5 minutes and most of the time wont even reconnect unless I turn my bluetooth off then back on. I can't walk 15 feet away from my phone without the sound going out. The battery life is a joke and the sounds is just okay. For their price, they should be much higher quality. Save your money and frustration and invest in a different brand."
3732,"May 17, 2020",5.0,In love!,  They’re great. 100% recommend
3733,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Love these AirPods!,  Love my AirPods. I use them all the time and the battery lasts a good while before needing another charge.
3734,"May 17, 2020",5.0,The best purchase ever,"  I loved it, I always wanted one but I was debating with myself if is worthy or not but is 100% worthy , I have been using everyday since i got it. The air pods battery life depends of how much you are going to use of course but case battery life is amazing its at least 3 days."
3735,"May 17, 2020",5.0,The AirPods are very useful!,  I’m very satisfied with the Purchase.I have been using it all the time and enjoy the freedom! T tv hank you
3736,"May 17, 2020",2.0,Mic stopped working after 4 months.,"  I’ve had these less than 5 months and although they still work great for listening, the microphone stopped working a month ago. It is muffled and constantly cuts in and out. I cannot use them for calls or meetings because of this. So frustrating to have paid so much money and have a half useless tech."
3737,"May 17, 2020",5.0,"Take advantage of low price, get these!","  Do not listen to others saying they got fake ones. If you buy this with the price listed above, then you will not get a fake one. I got a brand new pair, complete with the plastic wrap and everything. Works great, sound quality is great- I don’t have to crank up the volume all the way to hear, which is nice. These are not meant for noise-cancelling, though. As for sturdiness, I do have to push them back into my ear a couple times, but that’s expected. Very worth for a cheap price. 10/10 recommend. I can get ones from the apple store and they’ll be exactly the same."
3738,"May 17, 2020",4.0,airpods 2,"  this airpods are very good, sound excelent. but somee times have not great connection i dont if is my app Spotify or de aidpos. also this airpods 2 is amazing."

3741,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Why Did I Wait So Long?,"  Wow, these airpods are fantastic! They are very comfortable and easily synced with my phone. I listen to a lot of audiobooks as well as music and these are just the best.I wear in-the-ear hearing aids and Apple makes the only earbuds I can use. I have a lot of the corded type. These are the exact style.I'm so happy I bought these. The only downside for me is battery life. But that's minor."
3742,"May 17, 2020",1.0,They don’t last long,  I’ve had these air pods for 8 mos and I just went to use them and the right one is blown. Have no idea how that happened usually apple stuff is very good quality
3743,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Love tyem,  Great sound
3744,"May 17, 2020",1.0,Broke in 4 months,  Bought for Christmas gift and already one doesn't work and the battery barely charges waste of money and disappointment
3745,"May 17, 2020",5.0,Perfect!,  These are wonderful!  It’s the best purchase I’ve made in a long time.  The sound quality is excellent!  They stay put in your ears during a long run and you don’t even notice they’re in your ears!  No more fighting with ear cords!  Excellent product!

3758,"May 16, 2020",5.0,love them!,"  I am so happy I bit the bullet and bought these. The sound quality is great and they pair quite fast. Great for runs and jogs! I love being able to do them while washing dishes, etc. Also: make sure you are ordering directly from Amazon and NOT from a third party! If you’re ordering from a third party seller, you run the risk of receiving fake ones. No one ordering who has Amazon prime or is ordering them directly from Amazon is going to receive “fake” airpods. Be smart!"
3759,"May 16, 2020",3.0,Best device for hands free in work environments,"  I’m not going to lie, I was worried they wouldn’t stay in my ear as well- but Working in the medical field, I don’t have any issues with them falling out. They can have some difficulties with adjusting to just one headphone taken out and listening in the other still, as the headphones think you’re putting them away and you have to reconnect the Bluetooth. Overall though they work great, I can answer phone calls while doing dishes, or talk on the phone while driving and have no worries about accidents!"
3760,"May 16, 2020",1.0,Beware - The Warehouse steals them,"  Tried to order this for Mothers day, never arrived.  Got assistance from Customer Service, ordered replacement, 2nd time we got an empty box.  Order direct from Apple if you want to ensure you receive the product."
3761,"May 16, 2020",5.0,Apple products are always top of the line.,"  Very nice packaging and design.  The sound is also great, they fit in my ears perfect.  They are very small, which I like a lot.  I hope I don't lose them!"

3772,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Real.,  Everything about these are great! They are real. The only thing is that the sound quality isn’t the best because it’s just a bit low and I would expect them to be more loud.

3800,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Good quality,"  These are another great Apple product, just shat we have come to expect from Apple"
3801,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Quality,  Great product amazing sound. 👍 glad I purchased it
3802,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Love these!,"  Love them!! Was kind of hesitant buying them at first, but definitely don’t regret buying at all!! Easy to set up, and to use. My only problem is I can’t figure out the double tap to pause, next. But overall, love!"
3803,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Affordable,"  Don’t waste your money on the AirPod 2’s there the same thing, these are more affordable!"
3804,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  I’d definitely buy another pair
3805,"May 15, 2020",5.0,Daughter Loves them... maybe too much.,"  I ordered these for my daughter for her birthday. I was halfway nervous though because I did not know what the outcome was going to be because some of the reviews scared me a little but when these arrived they were in perfect condition. My daughter was so excited and thanked me almost everyday for the first 2 weeks for these pods! She wears them everyday, all day. Wondering if my next purchase is going to be hearing aids though🙄. Lol."
3806,"May 14, 2020",1.0,Mothers Day Gift **** FAIL ****** Defective and Dirty,  1.  One pod was muffled while other pod was fine.  Fully charged and tried again.  Independently confirmed faulty pod with different iphones of 20-somethings.2.  Caked piece of dirt under closed case lid.  Was located both on underside of lid near hinge and the surface where the pods are inserted - in plain sight.  Tried to scrape off but could not.  Packaging was clearly factory from outside to inside.Between dirt and defective equipment it sure seemed like manufacturer repackaged faulty and/or poor Quality Control.  Not a good look for Mothers Day with family around.  Wife deserves upgrade to noise cancelling. Returning for replacement.  Hopefully wife gets before school year over (kindergarten teacher using Zoom).
3807,"May 14, 2020",5.0,great purchase,"  these are great! the sound quality is great. only con about these, is that the case drops battery pretty quickly, but that might be because i just got time, i think they will adjust."
3808,"May 14, 2020",4.0,You need airpods now,"  Don;t know why I waited so long to get these. They're not perfect but they're pretty great. Biggest complaint right now is that sometimes the left or right one won't connect or produce sound. Usually, disconnecting and reconnecting via Bluetooth will fix it. They recharge fast in the case."
3809,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Great sound quality and quick pairing,  Perfect for exercise and walking around the city.  These are a must for traveling on a plane as the noise cancellation on the AirPods will make you feel like there’s no one around.  They also pair easily with my other apple devices.  My only small complaint is I wish they were easier to clean.
3810,"May 14, 2020",4.0,Era para regalo y no llegó asi,  Este producto lo solicitamos para un regalo y no llego así !
3811,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Outstanding all around,  Second pair I have had.  Great sound and battery life in a Bluetooth scenario.  Lost my last pair sadly.  These came quickly with no issue.  Highly recommended
3812,"May 14, 2020",4.0,yeet,  yeet
3813,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Best for your dollar,"  Best bang for your buck, won’t be disappointed. From the build quality to sound quality you will be glad to have purchased these over beats"
3814,"May 14, 2020",1.0,Used AirPods,"  Don’t buy these from here. I received used AirPods in a pandemic?! It was clear when my phone sync with pods the previous owners name popped up. For this price, sorely disappointed to receive used product. Otherwise, like most Apple products their great and good quality"
3815,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Cant function without them now,  Love!
3816,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Calidad,  Todo bien
3817,"May 14, 2020",1.0,Not good,"  After 2 weeks, speakers went out."
3818,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  My child has been asking for airpods for the longest time, and we finally caved in and got her airpods for her birthday. She claims they are the best thing, and she was so happy when she opened them for her birthday! Great product, very easy to set up, sound quality and battery life is fantastic. I would 100% recommended this product."
3819,"May 14, 2020",1.0,TERRIBLE,"  These crackle all the time, they cut in and out when I am on phone calls, and don't work well.  I cannot rely on them and they are brand new"
3820,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Genuine AirPods,"  I have been wanting these for a while, and when I saw that they were generally cheap on Amazon I was skeptical. But these are genuine AirPods.They're great, they fit snugly in the ear and sometimes I don't even notice that I have them in. I didn't get the wireless charging case because I have a charging station and if you set the AirPods on the charging station it works similarly. Maybe I'll eventually decide to get a charging case but this works for me for now."
3821,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Convenient,  Great airpods but shouldn’t be as expensive as they are.
3822,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Yego en condiciones perfecta,  Muy buenos
3823,"May 14, 2020",5.0,N/a,  N/a
3824,"May 14, 2020",4.0,They are nice every day ear buds,"  They are nice every day ear buds but if you are an audiophile looking for a nifty new pair of wireless ear buds I would either go for the pro or another company like Jabra or Bose.  The Quality is good but without that tight fitting seal you get with the Pro and other models,  base can fade as the buds work lose.  I think they are perfect for the gym though."
3825,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Sound quality is excellent,"  If you're an airpod hater like me, and don't mind using the regular earbuds w/the cord, you will be converted after one try. Trust me."
3826,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Clearer and better sound,  Gave this to my sister as a gift. She loves them.
3827,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Amazing
3828,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"  These earbuds are great. I was hesitant to get them at first, fearing they would fall out of my ears or I would lose them. They are secure in my ears whenever I wear them and carrying them around in the charging case makes it less likely to lose them. I did forget about them in my pocket and ran them through the wash. I took them out and they played normally right away. I put them in rice for 72 hours and they still played fine.I have used these with my iPhone XS, Windows 10 laptop and iPad and for all devices they work great.I am still getting used to the commands/taps that come with these. I would like to find more info on that.I bought these when they were under $100, which I felt was a steal. They are great to have!"
3829,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  Good product and good price.
3830,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Great it’s,  Great item
3831,"May 14, 2020",5.0,Invest in these,"  These are something I had put off buying, and I wish I had bought them sooner. I love the fit and they never fall out- something that I struggled with other wireless headphones when exercising! They charge fast and I love that the case is sleek and simple. They aren’t completely noise canceling, which is not something I’d hold against them due to me not buying them for that reason. The sound does get pretty loud for myself. I’d definitely recommend getting a case, but it’s not completely necessary."
3832,"May 13, 2020",5.0,🤘,  Hell yeah these bitches are great
3833,"May 13, 2020",1.0,If I spend my money I want my product,  I didn’t get my AirPods but got the case
3834,"May 13, 2020",5.0,As Expected!,"  I got this exact model for a Christmas present. I only got to use them for a week before my 17 year old decided she wanted to “try them out” she continued to try them out until she got her own on her 18th birthday. She loves them. This is saying a lot for someone who has never liked earbuds and always preferred a bulky, non ear protruding device. 5+++ stars"
3835,"May 13, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"  As any other Apple product, these are amazing"
3836,"May 13, 2020",1.0,Not brand new,  I paid brand new price for these and when I got them and attached them to my iPhone to pair them they said brads airbuds??  I’m pissed are these someone else’s??  I want new ones
3837,"May 13, 2020",5.0,They legit,  Great!
3838,"May 13, 2020",1.0,These are refurbished or  fake!!!,  Don’t buy !!! Buy them at your local Best Buy or official Apple website. I just received them and as I’m testing them out fresh out the box they are fully charged so I put on a song to hear the quality and only the left one was working. I tried different apps and videos and the left one is the only one that works. The right one does not work at all I will be contacting them about this. Never have I ever had a problem with Apple. These are either refurbished or FAKE !!!!
3839,"May 13, 2020",1.0,AirPod not working,  One side don’t work. I had to request a new one from amazon.
3840,"May 13, 2020",5.0,"Game changer for talking, etc","  These are the real deal.  I love them.  Didn’t realize I needed them till I started wearing them.I can walk around the house without my phone attached to my hand and carry on a conversation while doing other things.Sound quality on both sides is excellent.Also, they stay put...even while jogging.  Comfortable and charge quickly.Not as bulky as my beloved Bose.  Great to have both.I wear these every day.  Excellent ear buds!"

3856,"May 13, 2020",4.0,"It works greats, and battery life isn't that bad.","  I've had these for about an year now and I use them mostly everyday for about an hour or so. The sound quality won't blow you away for the price but it isn't bad. The battery life I would say is ok, but the one bad thing is that with iphones 6 and lower the connection time is longer."
3857,"May 13, 2020",5.0,Made a wonderful gift!,  Good product!!! Great buy!!! Still doing the job!!!
3858,"May 13, 2020",5.0,These are awesome you need to buy them,  I love Them and that you can double tap them to hang up and skip music fit in my ears amazing love the battery life and my dislike is that the Charging Case falls off my nightstand too much

How did I ever live without them?My only complain is the charging case. Mine was dead on arrive, fails to hold a charge, light turns off automatically when trying to charge. I've tried hard resets, and resyncing to no avail.Will have to pickup a 3rd party charging case in the near future."

3867,"May 13, 2020",5.0,Tiny but mighty,"  At this point (after 2 months of everyday use and having dropped them a lot), I don’t know how I’ve lived without them. The charge time is so short I can’t believe it, and then it lasts damn near all day. I love these. They don’t even fall out of my ear like I was worried they would.Plus, they can play a sound from your find my iPhone app if you misplace one!!"
3868,"May 13, 2020",5.0,Love these!,  The sounds quality is amazing!! They fit great and I feel like they cancel outside noise. I recommend!
3869,"May 13, 2020",5.0,Very good,"  These AirPods are really good and don’t fall out of your ears, it also has very good battery life,but I don’t think it’s worth $160"
3870,"May 13, 2020",5.0,As described,  Awesome item
3871,"May 12, 2020",5.0,Best wireless earbuds,  Definitely worth the money to get these over any of the knockoffs. These stay paired to your phone and continue to offer great sound. Can’t go wrong with the quality of Apple

3876,"May 12, 2020",5.0,Will recommend but would like to review them myself,  Not hearing many good reviews on this but maybe I can review them for myself but I still have faith in the airpods😁.
3877,"May 12, 2020",5.0,Buy them.,  Mine are great. They last long. I can use one if I just wanted too. They charge in the case. They work with your iPhone charger. Easy too connect. I can hear conversations from another room. (Creepy lol). One will ding if I end up losing it in the house from the FIND app on your phone. I highly recommend.

3883,"May 12, 2020",5.0,Android use,  I got these instead of the Samsung buds just because of appearance and im pleasantly surprised at the actual performance of these things be it im not using an apple device. Battery life is solid and so is the sound plus they are pretty comfortable but this is subjective.

3886,"May 12, 2020",4.0,Previously Used. Not new,  I just wanted to write that I just received these Airpods from amazon and they had been used. They were not new. They were not put in the box correctly and when I connected them with my iphone it read someone (Eileen) else’s name. I have no idea where they came from.
3887,"May 12, 2020",1.0,Be weary of purchasing AirPods from Amazon,"  Be weary of purchasing AirPods from Amazon. I received an unsealed and dirty box. At first I thought nothing of it until I saw that the AirPods had already been named when I went to pair them. At closer examination, I noticed the AirPods themselves were actually dirty. They also didn’t come with a manual. I couldn’t get over the fact they might have been in some random persons ears and returned them. Just bought a new pair from a store and the box was sealed, came with a manual and were unnamed."

3900,"May 12, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  We purchased a knock off pair and ended up returning and biting the bullet on these. My husband uses them every single day and absolutely loves them. Worth every penny!
3901,"May 12, 2020",1.0,Stopped working less the month,  Owned this for less than a month and the case stopped charging the headphones and would no longer turn them off when putting them in the case. I wouldn't recommend this product.

When I received the package today, I opened the box to find that the AirPods and the case were not in the box - it only included the charging cable.

3914,"May 12, 2020",5.0,Worth the money!!!,  I was worried about buying these off amazon but I’m so glad I did. The battery life is so long. Fits perfect in my pocket to charge. They sound amazing.
3915,"May 12, 2020",1.0,AirPods suck,  They don’t connect as soon as your put them in your ear . They take forever to connect sometimes it says connected and you can’t hear anything not even through the phone
3916,"May 12, 2020",2.0,Most often one works and one doesn’t. Goes back and forth between pods.,  My daughter has had these for 3 weeks and from the beginning one would work and one wouldn’t. Was told it was how they were connecting wirelessly. So she would disconnect and reconnect and they would work. Here it is 3 weeks later and one doesn’t work at all. We have troubleshot then for 3 days now and still not working. Apple stores are not open in our area. Disappointed in the product especially for spending 150$ on them.

3926,"May 11, 2020",5.0,so great!,"  When these first came out i was honestly skeptical, thinking I wouldn’t need them and they would be no different from the wireless headphones i already had. BUT I WAS SO WRONG!! I can not go anywhere without them now! The sound quality really proves to be worth the cost and they are so comfortable to wear. I have a tendency to forget they’re even in my ears sometimes. I’ve gotten these as gifts for so many people and everyone has been so happy with them!"
3927,"May 11, 2020",2.0,Chose new but not new,  Bought these thinking they were brand new for my wife for Mother’s Day. She tested them out and it said they were Gracie’s . Think there was a mix up...not new!

3929,"May 11, 2020",1.0,Worst product ever - Apple does not support them,"  So, the first set stopped working within a couple days.  The replacement set started having garbled sound in 4 months and after diagnosing it for 45 minutes with Apple Support, they said that would replace them for $150.98, even though they were under warranty and that's because they have limited warranty.  I asked for a supervisor.  When I he came on the line, he went through all the same steps again and said that he would replace them for free.  What is happening with Apple??  Anyway, it finally worked out, but I did have to give them my credit card to be charged until the old ones were received back, since they are sending the replacement in advance.  They can still decide not to accept the returned item.  If they do, I will come back and update this."
3930,"May 11, 2020",1.0,Received a fake knock off,  Received fake knock off wireless earbuds from China.
3931,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Prácticos y livianos,"  Me encantan, son muy prácticos"
3932,"May 11, 2020",5.0,So glad I finally purchased,"  I was sooooo hesitant on purchasing AirPods. I’ve been plotting on the idea for months, literally. Let me start by saying, I AM SO HAPPY I FINALLY DID. I actually ordered my boyfriend a pair too. Prior to owning airpods my only wireless headphones were Beats Solo 3s. What a difference, AirPods are so convenient, comfortable, reliable, and so much more! The sound is awesome and they are so easy to operate. I’d recommend them to everyone and I’d say if you’ve been hesitant like I have you should take the leap!"
3933,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Love it,  They work fine. But don’t wear it for to long. I bothers
3934,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Perfect headphones,  Love it!
3935,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Great product and they are a legit Apple product,  Everyone knows the quality of AirPods but I am witting this for people who think they may get counterfeit AirPods.  Just go to checkcoverage.apple.com and enter the serial number.  It will confirm they’re legit
3936,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Great sound!,"  Was amazing, now I know why they were highly recommend. Thanks a bunch!"
3937,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Good,  I like it!
3938,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Affordable easy to use,"  Nice buy , after a month or so I starung having problems with sound , not sure it is there is ear wax from someone or mine, just like I read on some other people reviews but that stopped is not doing it as often I try to cleaned up on the outside of course so that might helped- The distance range it’s questionable to me - sometimes I loose signal from one room to another room inside my house (phone on different room) other than that packeting was good - not sealed plastic but it looked new to me ."
3939,"May 11, 2020",5.0,5 stars,  Impressive sound comfortable and long life on the battery.
3940,"May 11, 2020",1.0,"Apple makes good computers, but....",  Never worked...wished my kids would have told me so the return window wasn't elapsed.  Tried like hell to get them to work...nada.
3941,"May 11, 2020",5.0,On time for Christmas,  She love it. Thanks
3942,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Excellent!,  The product came in as described! Functions perfectly.
3943,"May 11, 2020",5.0,perfect earbuds for apple users,  perfect
3944,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Very useful,  Works perfectly
3945,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Exactly what I needed,"  I kept buying cheap ear buds to use when I run and the sound quality was bad and they would fall out of my ears. These were definitely worth paying for. They stay in my ears, are comfortable and block out noises around you (when the volume is above 0 of course)."
3946,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Great purchase!,"  I have been using my AirPods for about 5 months, and they have been great for me! I only really have had trouble with the sound and getting in my ear. The trouble I’m having with the sound just started showing up now, the right AirPod has been a little quieter and still after I cleaned it, it’s a little quieter. The only other complaint is that they sometimes fall out of my ears (I expected it to happen) but I can still run in them if I put them in really well. Overall a great purchase and I highly recommend!"
3947,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Love my Airpods,  I swear by my Airpods - they are my go-to in-ear headphones - so when my girlfriend said she couldn't find earbuds that she really liked I bought her these. She wears them daily.
3948,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Awesome headphones!!,  Just love these.  My first wireless set and so comfortable.
3949,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Good buy shipped & delivered same day,  Item was shipped to the wrong address . However I Managed to retrieve them . I love my AirPods
3950,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Sons airpods.,  Son got new airpods and was amazed at how easy they connect. He does enjoy opening and closing them. Satisfied parent.
3951,"May 11, 2020",1.0,it was just a box NO AirPods,  I was so exited to get AirPods for my mom and the I opened the package and there was just a box and a charger.
3952,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Works great
3953,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods with Charging Case,  excellent product highly recommend
3954,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Authentic and Awesome,  I have prime and they arrived the next day! They are authentic apple airpods and I am loving them!
3955,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Love my AirPods!!,  I live my AirPods. I listen to books all day while I deliver mail. It is perfect. I don’t have to worry about cords getting in the way. Excellent sound quality.
3956,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Use them a lot for work and they are fantastic
3957,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Excelente
3958,"May 11, 2020",5.0,Perfect Gift,"  Bought 2, one for my son and one for my husband. Both love it. Works perfectly"
3959,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Better than I expected,"  I bought these really just to say I had them but within the first couple minutes of use I could really see the appeal to them. They’re comfortable in my ears at least, their battery life is surprisingly long, the sound quality is honestly better than any other headphone I’ve used wired or wireless, they have more applications than just listening to music as well."
3960,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Very happy,  I am extremely happy with these. Ott r I finally I went with a different brand but I can’t deal with headphones right inside your ears very deep. These ones are providing very good sound and not super deep in the ears and very easy to charge and easy to get out of the charging box too. A bit pricy but worth the investment!
3961,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great shipping,  Great
3962,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Authentic Apple Product!,  I just got these about 2 days ago and I’m already super satisfied! I love them and the price I got them for! Some people were saying that these were fake but that’s not true. I received 100% authentic apple airpods!
3963,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  Working out
3964,"May 10, 2020",5.0,not worth the hype,"  these do not live up to the hype. the airpods do not fit in my ears, they don’t have any sort of noise canceling, and the most i’ve gotten out of two pairs is three months of regular use. the first pair only lasted a month. i sent them back under warranty and they sent me a new pair. and yesterday ( May 9) the right airpod blew out. these lasted only three months. i’ve had a pair of beats solo 2 for almost three years. these are also technically an apple product and i am disappointed in the amount of time that these expensive listening devices last. i refuse to believe that this is a coincidence because i have had two identical pairs and both resulted in the same outcome."
3965,"May 10, 2020",4.0,Good i like them!,  Great but these totally will fall out of your ear.
3966,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  AirPods are easy to use and make it much easier on a daily basis
3967,"May 10, 2020",5.0,The best ear buds,  Super awesome
3968,"May 10, 2020",1.0,STOPPED WORKING!!,"  I've only had these bipods since January and they have completely stopped working! At first, the sound kept going in and out and the quality was unclear. This would happen when the AirPods would be fully charged. I am also a person that is extremely careful of my belonging so I always had them in a safe place and never dropped them. Now they completely don't work. This was a rip off and I am highly disappointed!"
3969,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great item,  Arrived fast and as described
3970,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great headphones!,"  I bought these because I lost my other wireless headphones. I was skeptical at first because it is an apple product. However, these do not hurt my ear, good sound and easy to set up and use. Battery life is great. I would recommend buying a carrying case because they are so small that it can be easy to misplace them. Overall great!"
3971,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great for active people,  Just what I expected. Great to have!
3972,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Work great,"  Got for my son, and want a pair myself!"
3973,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Son loves them
3974,"May 10, 2020",5.0,IF YOURE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THEM- DO ITTT!,"  I seen a review that they were fake, but they came EXACTLY like they were supposed to and they see 100% real for the lowered price they are definitely worth it."
3975,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  Great! So glad I bit the bullet!
3976,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Of course it’s great,  My husband loves these. He uses them to work out and he’s surprised how well they stay in his ears.
3977,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods Deal,"  Getting the AirPods for $139 is a definite value.  They are not the Pro version so don't expect noise cancelation but, overall, a nice value for the money.  Easy to pair and use with a decent battery life.  Would recommend!"
3978,"May 10, 2020",5.0,"Great product, no issues","  Worked right out of the box (both ear pods were at 80% and case was at 76%) also included lightning cable. Sound quality is great, very happy with them!"
3979,"May 10, 2020",5.0,That’s it’s worth your money,  Very good sound quality
3980,"May 10, 2020",1.0,Missing AirPods,  AirPods was missing in the box
3981,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Present,"  I gave my wife, she is very happy."
3982,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Perfect product and amazing shipping time!,  These are amazing! Especially if you have the watch. Makes it so much more convenient for phone calls and text when you have 3 children. Give you the possibility to be 100% hands free!!
3983,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great investment,  I like that the battery life is good and I use them to listen to music or watch a show.
3984,"May 10, 2020",3.0,Hurt/bruised my ears,"  The sound was great, but after a few minutes, they hurt my ears...I must have small ear canals. I returned them and am considering AirPod Pros with the silicone tips."
3985,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Good sound quality,  Came quickly and in perfect condition. The work great. No issues
3986,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Excellent 👍👍👌👍 Cool 😎😎😎,  Excellent 👍👍👌👌👌 Cool 😎😎😎
3987,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Great,  Headphones are great
3988,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  My wife enjoys it!
3989,"May 10, 2020",5.0,Amazing,"  Perfect item! Fits well, great sound, easy to use, strong case! I car went over it and nothing happened!"
3990,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Daughter loves them,  My daughter loves them. I tried them and they sound great.
3991,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Perfect,"  Good gift 🎁, works well, you should buy!"
3992,"May 9, 2020",5.0,May need accessories for a better fit,"  Got these as a gift and they work wonderfully, they don’t quite stay fit snugly in my ear though so I did purchase some ear hooks to help keep them from falling out."
3993,"May 9, 2020",2.0,not happy,  i have problems with this airpods since I bought this when I talk to someone all the way disconnect I am not happy with this airpord
3994,"May 9, 2020",3.0,They fall out very often,"  Solid! Except, they fall out of ny ears nonstop!! i’ve tried all the sizing options but to no avail. They fall out every few minutes. Ugh!"
3995,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Awesome! defiantly buy!,"  I bought these for my daughter and she loved them!  the sound quality is great and they are very atheistically beautiful!! Defiantly would purchase again, when others say they were used or dirty, or fake they probably got them from a used sight.  But these are awesome AirPods!"
3996,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,  How did I live without these?  They are amazing.
3997,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Handy,  I love em. I’ve been waiting to buy them for a long time now and I’m glad I did. They arrived when expected and they come in really handy while I’m at work.
3998,"May 9, 2020",3.0,It’s good.,  Bought this AirPod after I lost my wireless charging AirPod 2. Didn’t want to pay for the same one again. It works better than expected. Only problem so far is that my phone can’t really pick up the signal when the AirPod is opened. It has a hard time showing the battery level of the AirPods. Hopefully I won’t have any other problems with it.
3999,"May 9, 2020",5.0,LEGIT,  These are legit the real thing. It’s not a gimmick. I recommend these because  of the price and quality  of the product.
4000,"May 9, 2020",1.0,Do NOT trust this company.  The sold us AirPods that had been returned.,  Today I went to the Apple to exchange airpods because the airpods I bought on 12/7/2019 were not working properly.  Upon further investigation the representative told me that they could not exchange the bad Airpod because the case is a series 1 and the actual airpods are series 2.  The worst part is that they were originally bought in June 2019 and the warranty will soon be out.  This is ridiculous!  Now I have to figure out how to get in touch with the seller.  DO NOT buy from this company!!!  Don't do it.
4001,"May 9, 2020",5.0,👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾😘💋,  😍😍😍
4002,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Love this airpords,"  Eveything went fine with the entire order, love the product!"
4003,"May 9, 2020",4.0,How can we fix this,  The left AirPod keeps powering off every five minutes
4004,"May 9, 2020",1.0,Empty box received,  Ordered AirPods received a dirty empty box.
4005,"May 9, 2020",1.0,My charger never worked,"  I received them fast, but the charger never worked. Luckily I have another charger, would like partial refund or a ne battery if someone would get back to me."
4006,"May 9, 2020",4.0,Love Them,  I've had them for a couple of days now and I love them. They are comfortable in my ears. I thought they would be uncomfortable but I was quite surprised.
4007,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Love,"  I bloody love these things.I don't have an iPhone, I'm an android lady and I still love these things.Sound quality and microphone quality are second to none, and they last forever battery, wise.Admittedly that get a little sore in my ears after a few hours, but....hours. And I have really small ears.I went through four other sets of headphones though again that were a fraction of the price and they all sucked in one way or another, and I ended up returning them, very disappointed. I sucked it up and bought these and never looked back.If you're hemmin' and hawin'...just buy them already."
4008,"May 9, 2020",4.0,Theres a reason why everyone loves them,"  I ordered these and a pair of Bultone ear buds in the same month. These are one of the best purchases I have ever made in terms of convenience, lifestyle enhancement, and general happiness.Pros:1. sound quality - perfect for music - great, even tone and quality bass, reliable never any static or wonky pitches 2. Bluetooth connection - só reliable and easy to connect. Once paired with a device it’s seamless; just pop them in your ears. Can stray a pretty good distance from your device and still have good reception.3. Call quality & Siri - call quality is awesome and works without the other party even noticing I’m on Bluetooth. Have used them for both business and personal calls in the car and at home for hour long conferences as well as quick hit calls. Never had a problem with people hearing me or hearing the other parties. Really love that Siri announces notifications when I’m using them.4. Personalization - Love that you can tweak the controls to your own preferences.ConsCharging - While charging the ear buds is super fast and easy I will say that the charging case doesn’t seem to hold a charge as long as the Bultone case does. The buds themselves also don’t hold a charge as long as my Bultone buds do.Fit - I have very small ears and these are comfortable but they fall out occasionally. I am not comfortable wearing them out and about in public after having lost one on several occasions when it just spontaneously popped out of my ear.Price - would be nice if these were closer to the 99.00 price point. Just feel the 150.00 price range they hover in is a tad high but I would buy them again for sure"
4009,"May 9, 2020",4.0,Works for now,  When I first bought them they worked great now the left one doesn’t work .  I only use one anyway so it’s okay for me and the sound is great but battery life isn’t.
4010,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Great purchase,  Excellent product. Fast shipping.
4011,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Great purchase,"  At first I was skeptical about buying these through amazon but I took the risk, and I am beyond satisfied. Airpods are authentic, shipped and delivered right away. Thanks!"
4012,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Very Nice,  Very good set of earbuds
4013,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Must buy!!,"  Just perfect, got them for my sister in law and she couldn’t be any happier!"
4014,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Great Air Pods,  Great gift for husband. He uses them all the time. Says they are very clear.
4015,"May 9, 2020",5.0,good sound,  Good product. Exactly as described.
4016,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  Really great quality and worth the price!!!
4017,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Keep them in the case when not using,  They do not stay in ears
4018,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Works great!,  Works perfectly. Only complaint is some of the parts of the charging case lid hold a lot of dust and dirt but it’s able to be cleaned with a q-tip.
4019,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Love these and find it extremely difficult to go back to EarPods that have a cord.
4020,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Great,  Just what I expected!
4021,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Buena compra,  Excelente artículo
4022,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Only one ear works,  Only one ear works
4023,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Get them thet are amazing,  this is my fist time buying anything apple from here good so far  i bought a pair for me and one for my boyfriend i love these and highly recommend
4024,"May 9, 2020",5.0,they work perfect,  Love them!
4025,"May 9, 2020",5.0,Thank you so much,  I Love ❤️
4026,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Very good quality APPLE products u can never go wrong.,  My husband loves these things !!!
4027,"May 8, 2020",5.0,No problems.,  Works as expected!
4028,"May 8, 2020",2.0,Not the Best Buy from Apple,  Not the best air pods I’ve gotten
4029,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Like it very much,  Like I it
4030,"May 8, 2020",5.0,I loved these,  Pretty goof
4031,"May 8, 2020",5.0,They are a cheap purchase,  I just It them today and they are incredible!!!!
4032,"May 8, 2020",1.0,Please send replacement product,  The AirPod were not in box and the case had multiple damages.  This is not acceptable.
4033,"May 8, 2020",5.0,"Sound, look, price. All perfect","  I was kinda scared how they would work since I have a Motorola, but oh my god. The sound is stunning, such a sleek design and very nice looking. The only issue was that my ears are kinda small, not insanely but I guess smaller than others, and they hurt the top section of where you put them, but I'm sure I'll get used to them. Perfect size, great for the price, bass is amazing, and you can rename them on Motorola as well. Overall, very happy."
4034,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Its what's expected,"  Ordered a new pair of Apple Airpods since her left airpod was seeming to fade and the quality was iffy at best.  So far she loves them (any young teenager would), sound is awesome and battery life is also good."
4035,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Worth the money!!,"  These headphones are definitely worth the higher price point!! The sound quality is way better than I expected, and they sit perfectly in the ear. Not to mention not having wires dangling is a HUGE plus."
4036,"May 8, 2020",1.0,Empty box,  The box is empty when I opened it
4037,"May 8, 2020",1.0,!!!!NOT NEW!!!!,  This product is either used or refurbished. Gave to my daughter as a birthday gift and when she paired it had someone else’s name.
4038,"May 8, 2020",5.0,A little slow shipping but I guess that's because of the outbreak.,  Granddaughter love it......
4039,"May 8, 2020",2.0,Ear buds die within a couple of hours,"  The ear buds die quickly.  I know people who can go hours, if not all day with them in and no issues.  I have to recharge mine multiple times a day, which is extremely inconvenient when I am on the phone all day long.Not very comfortable either."
4040,"May 8, 2020",4.0,Great buds for the price; I like them better than the Pros!,"  Ok there not Hi-fi, but there pretty darn good! I initially bought the AirPods Pro for the noise canceling (I fly a lot)! However, after  using them after several flights, I hated the white noise they produced, as well as, the fit just did not work for me. I tried several ear tips but they kept falling out. That being said the AirPods 2 are great for my ears (no white noise) yes they don’t have active noise canceling but I think the sound great for the price. They also fit my ears perfectly. Reason for four stars is that as an Apple product who owns beats I expected better highs and mid-tones. They do have pretty good base for the size of the ear pod and the sound is not blown out. Unlike the beats pro. I also got Apple care via Apple (recommendation: use amazon to buy Apple care, you’ll save yourself a headache trying to get apple to verify your purchase it was about a half hour of work to get apple to override the system and apply the Apple care. But they were friendly and did Got it done.)"
4041,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Great sound quality!,"  I really enjoy listening to these while I work; it's portable, quite noise canceling and I was surprised at how clear the sound quality was compared to my other generic bluetooth ear buds that I had used prior to buying these. The only thing I wish that could be improved is the battery life. Unfortunately it can only last you up to 4 or 5 hours before you have to slide it back into its case for charging."
4042,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Love!!,  I love them! I got them within 2 days also! They’re second gen for everyone wondering (I checked my warranty through apple). They’re very loud and the sound quality is amazing!
4043,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Its apple,  Its apple. What do you expect. 10/10.
4044,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Perfect! 👌🏾
4045,"May 8, 2020",3.0,A bit disappointing,"  I'm not sure if it's because these were Resell on Amazon, but the sound quality doesn't sound as good and the corded Apple earphones. A little disappointed. They are convenient however as far as working out"
4046,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Very good quality and well worth the money.,  It doesnt really have sound cancellation like the Airpod Pros do but my daughter loves them. I bought ghem for her 16th birthday present and she uses them nonstop!! Brand new. She has an iPhone 7plus even connect to androids too. Connects to her apple watch series 3 and connects great.
4047,"May 8, 2020",1.0,Left pod problems,  After charging for 12 hours it kept telling me the left pod was dead (5%) and would not work. Eventually it got to where no one could hear anything I was saying even though I could hear them clearly. Very frustrating and not what I expect from Apple or any product that costs $160
4048,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Great Product,  No negatives here. They rarely come out of my ears and that's all I can say.
4049,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Works great
4050,"May 8, 2020",1.0,Poor battery life/noise interference with music,"  I’m NOT impressedThey make a funny noise while in use, it distorts the music.If battery life is at only half the right EarPod quits working.You should get more life out of the battery than just half."
4051,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great
4052,"May 8, 2020",5.0,good quality,"  Bought these for my 10 year old and he loves them. I would say the noise cancelation is perfect because he can never hear me when I talk lol. He made a comment the other day that they were almost dead, he put them on the charger, took a shower, and when he came back they were already fully charged... so they charge super fast!"
4053,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Love it,  My daughter is addicted to these things lol
4054,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Perfect,  Perfect!!
4055,"May 8, 2020",1.0,Left AirPod defective. Purchased 2 weeks ago.,  I purchased these AirPods a few weeks ago (April 20).  They typically hold a charge for less than 3hours and  the left earbud only charges 50% of the time.
4056,"May 8, 2020",5.0,Best AirPods,  Got them Wednesday. Battery life was still on 67% when I put to charge 2Am on Friday morning.I can hear people when I have them on & others hear my musicEasy to add to phone. Love my AirPods
4057,"May 7, 2020",4.0,Mic issues,  Just what I expected. Nice and sealed in the brand new box. Were good for 2 months but now people are complaining they cannot hear me when talking to them using the airpods on a call. Still a good value and buy.
4058,"May 7, 2020",1.0,Over priced Apple as always,"  Way over priced compared to, well basically everything else. Sound quality is I would say average. But hay, they have the apple logo on them so people will buy :)"
4059,"May 7, 2020",5.0,"Good quality, great battery life",  The battery life of this product has been impressive. It’s been a week of regular use and the charging case has allowed for 100% charge each time I take them out. Impressive.
4060,"May 7, 2020",3.0,apple,  not worth the price
4061,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Works well!,  Happy with my purchase.
4062,"May 7, 2020",5.0,apple,  its what you expect from apple
4063,"May 7, 2020",5.0,great,  they are awesome
4064,"May 7, 2020",1.0,Filthy.,"  These pods were disgusting. The metal mesh was completely clogged smooth (couldn’t see netting of mesh) with a greasy black filth. The tip of each end mic, same thing. I used rubbing alcohol and 13 double sided Q-tips to clean them. I should’ve just paid more for new ones. They work though. But if you are going to refurbish, the speaker cannot be clogged with grease & dirt it effects sound quality etc.  Apple has cleaning kits at store for iPhone speakers that might work here as well. Clean them better, I was grossed out."
4065,"May 7, 2020",5.0,TOTALLY RECOMMEND👍🏾,  I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!!! YOU SHOULD BUY😁
4066,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Great product and arrived in a timely manner!!,  Loved time frame to get them. It was accurate.
4067,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Product Had Broke Within A Month Of Purchased,  I had purchased the AirPods lil less then a month ago & they were working totally fine yesterday and then today I put them on & my left AirPods had sounded static.. I have tried to unpair them from my phone & had paired them to another phone thinking it might be the phone & the same thing.. & I had went to hit up the people I’d bought them from “amazon” & they had nowhere to contact them?? soo i am stuck with a $100+ head phones that sound like $hit
4068,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Love them! Battery life is great!
4069,"May 7, 2020",1.0,Por un cable sólo que negoció,  Sólo el cable llego
4070,"May 7, 2020",1.0,Pray you don’t need Apple support,  I wish I could rate these zero. Got a defective set. Contacted Apple support while they were still covered under warranty. They refused to even look at them unless I bought a new ear pod.
4071,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Perfecto,"  Excelente producto. Ninguna queso, llena bien las expectativas"
4072,"May 7, 2020",5.0,I want to know if I can exchange it to AirPods 2nd generation,  I use to have AirPods 2nd generations and I didn’t like the sound in this one
4073,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Air pods,  Work and sounds great
4074,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Happy with it,  Not the latest one but good
4075,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Very reliable (not water proof),  Great product!
4076,"May 7, 2020",4.0,Pretty great overall,"  I was hesitant at first, but these airpods quickly became a favorite of mine. Although the overall quality is great, but I would love it if the battery life was longer (a constant problem until we achieve infinite energy I guess). Although I don't believe it's completely noise canceling, I haven't found an issue with it so far. I would typically have to take a pod out or pause my audio in order to communicate with someone else. Also, I can see how people would easily lose these. A few close calls, but I've been good so far."
4077,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Not fake,"  The product came on time I was a bit nervous about receiving it considering that the reviews were no so great but I can 100% be sure that these are real , my package came sealing in the plastic and my AirPods came in perfect condition would definitely recommend And would repurchase again ."
4078,"May 7, 2020",3.0,Left year went dead,  I just bought these IPODS 4 months ago and already the left ear has died and will not work.
4079,"May 7, 2020",5.0,100% legit my guy 😂,  Came brand new all the comments that’s saying it’s fake nah cuz it’s 100% real came in the packaging and everything
4080,"May 7, 2020",1.0,Stops working in three months.,"  *I wrote this review initially in the spring, but it appears not to have been posted.*I got these for my stepdaughter’s birthday. She received them and started using them in the beginning of February and they worked great. For the last few weeks, however, the left one has not been working. Only the right one works. They have not been damaged, dropped, thrown, in water, in extreme cold or heat, nothing. She is very proud of them and takes excellent care of them. There is no reason why these should cost as much as they do if one side stops working after a couple of months."
4081,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Love,  Exactly as described
4082,"May 7, 2020",4.0,AirPods are great,  I am sure this was a good product but somehow mine went defective.  The seller was great in handling the return!
4083,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Another great product from Apple,  Fantastic product delivered on time
4084,"May 7, 2020",5.0,What took me so long!!!,  I love my air pods.  I can't believe I waited so long to buy myself a pair.  I love them.
4085,"May 7, 2020",4.0,"Great, but issues","  I like these better than the buds I bought that fit in the ear.  Those always fell out and started to hurt after about 20 minutes of use.  These sound great and don't fall out.  HOWEVER, I'm having pairing issues with my iphone/watch.  The sound doesn't always come through the headphones after connecting to my phone.  I have to stop and start several times to get it to go through the headphones.  Then if I pause and start again using my watch, I have to do the whole process of switching sound back to headphones.  I'm not sure what is happening.  I'm sure I'll figure it out.  I haven't had that issue with my ipad, so I'm sure it's something to do with the phone and watch working together.  Overall, these fit in my ear better than Echo Buds, the sound quality is good, but it's lacking noise cancelling.  I just didn't think it was worth $100 to go up to the Pros for that.."
4086,"May 7, 2020",1.0,Hate it,  Doesn’t look like real AirPods. It is really big and bulky.
4087,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Awesome!
4088,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Love!,  Husband wears these every night and the earphones stay in place. I’ve used them a few times and finally decided to order me a pair. Last a long time!
4089,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Apple ear buds,  I had item gift wrapped and shipped. The gift wrap is an option I would definitely choose again. Extremely impressed. Thank you
4090,"May 7, 2020",5.0,Pleased with purchase,  Product arrived promptly and was as described.
4091,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Wow love it!!!,  Great
4092,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Love!,"  Love this product! Just like shown in the photo, same exact condition as they would be in the Apple store"
4093,"May 6, 2020",5.0,bestseller,  great
4094,"May 6, 2020",3.0,Won’t stay in my ear,"  The AirPods arrived in great condition, nice packaging but they do not stay put in my ear at all. I attempted to wear one around the house while doing light chores and it fell out several times and required adjusting multiple times. I should have known that these wouldn’t work for me, my regular corded earbuds do the same thing. I don’t imagine that I’d be able to workout or do much of anything without them falling out. I’ll be returning them and purchasing a much more inexpensive pair that allows me to adjust the ear cover for a better fit. Good product for most, but not a good fit for meUpdate 5/14/20So these are advertised as being the latest generation. My case that came with the AirPods have a model number that would indicate the case is 1st generation. The AirPods have different model numbers that would indicate that they weren’t manufactured as pair. There’s something fishy with these although they work. Check your numbers......my settings on my phone show a model number that is in fact different than what’s printed on the actual device. I wouldn’t be surprised if these were refurbished, all the different serial numbers confirm that this wasn’t an original pair because they have different manufacture dates"
4095,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Your caller can hear you!,"  I've spent a lot of money buying less expensive wireless earbuds.  It's true you get what you pay for, don't get me wrong some of the others out there sound amazing!  The only downfall with other wireless earbuds is the static noise that your caller/ or who you call get when you are talking.  They have a hard time hearing you with the less expensive versions.  Easy to see why Apple still has the best products, its well worth the money."
4096,"May 6, 2020",5.0,E@sy to use,  Great product I highly recommend
4097,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Great !,  They arrived fast shipping. Everything came perfectly packaged as expected I’m very satisfied.
4098,"May 6, 2020",1.0,😠,  Arrived on time but obviously a used pair ....opened the case to reveal mold and mildew growing in case and in EarPods.
4099,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Buy them,  Nice
4100,"May 6, 2020",1.0,Need to talk to someone from Amazon now,  Well I got my package today and there are no AirPods in the box this box is completely empty it has a charging cable only customer service doesn’t seem to want to give me a call back or allow me to talk to somebody so this is getting a zero star and I need to talk to customer representative right now
4101,"May 6, 2020",5.0,airpods  are good,  I got this as a bday gift for my 16 year old. He loves it . Just a day before my purchase it was 10$ less :( could have saved  but too late 😀.over all he likes it.
4102,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Love them
4103,"May 6, 2020",1.0,THESE ARE NOT AIRPODS!,"  I own a pair of airpods, as do pretty much all the members of my family. I ordered these, seeing that they came from apple, for my dad, and what we got were NOT airpods. The charging cord did not fit, the button was missing, the airpods didn't even FIT IN THE CHARGING CASE. When they were delivered, the plastic wasn't wrapped around the box (which it always is when you buy any apple product), which was the first red flag. Then we opened them and saw the disaster that was inside. I'm so pissed, disappoint, annoyed. I don't know WHAT went wrong here, but I did not receive the product I ordered. I fully believe I was scammed, so just be careful."
4104,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Happy with my Airpods,  AirPods came in pristine condition. They work very well. I’m happy with my purchase. Would recommend them highly.
4105,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Great,  Works perfect

4110,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Satisfied with Apple,  Great Apple product! I was tired of using my wired headset.
4111,"May 6, 2020",1.0,Used already?,"  The order arrived in a box that was sealed yet, the actual Air pods box was not sealed. The inner wrapper for the case was not sealed. I did not order a refurbished or used item!"
4112,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Love them.,"  Originally I held of on this purchase and told myself it was silly and didn’t need it.. but finally I decided to splurge and I don’t regret it.Love these for vacuuming while still listening to podcast, audio books, or overall watching YouTube in bed while the house in quite.The only negative thing I can say is that they sometimes fall out of your ear, but very rarely"
4113,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Came just as expected!
4114,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Great product,  I really like this product. It’s a great investment for me to buy this product
4115,"May 6, 2020",1.0,Fakes,  Fake apple ipods!!!!
4116,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Air Rockin Pods!!! 🔥,  These are sick!!! 🔥 i was hesitant at first but hey a godo but worth every dollar.
4117,"May 6, 2020",5.0,There good !,  I bought this for my daughter and let me tell you this are good. I looked at some of the reviews afteri bought them and i was kinda skeptical but they came and there good don’t listen to the bad reviews i recommend this for anyone.

4119,"May 6, 2020",5.0,Very satisfied,  Quick delivery and item was perfect
4120,"May 6, 2020",5.0,These are the real thing.,"  They’re great! But so easy to lose, even with find my AirPods."
4121,"May 6, 2020",4.0,Same fit as the earphones that come with iPhone.,  Only get about 5hrs off a full charge. Fit much better than some other brands I’ve tried.
4122,"May 6, 2020",1.0,"They haven’t lasted a year yet, 3rd pair!!!",  My daughter is on her 3rd pair that have broken again!
4123,"May 6, 2020",1.0,"Not Worth It, Just buy it from Apple","  Worked for two days. On the second day, there was a lot of static in the right earbud. Charged them last night and now. they won't work or turn on at all."
4124,"May 5, 2020",5.0,wish i got the new model,"  these are nice, they get dirty fast though, i’d recommend getting a case to put them in because they’re easy to lose. also they don’t charge equally on both sides. but the battery life is decently long lasting"
4125,"May 5, 2020",5.0,It’s authentic !!!,  AirPod is complete authentic. Don’t hesitate to buy it. In some review they said it’s fake but people make sure to check it’s ship and sold by amazon.

4127,"May 5, 2020",1.0,Received empty box,  Received an empty box with just the cord.
4128,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Great Product!,"  I been wanting a pair of AirPods for a while now, but never really had the funds for them due to how expensive they were. But I saw these and I knew I had to have them once they came down in price. They arrived today and they really live up to the name! I been using them all day and I love how they fit in my ears comfortably and how easy it was to pair them. Not only that,but the sound quality is amazing and I love the little case it comes in. It's so cute! If you love Apple products, then this is for you! Five stars!"
4129,"May 5, 2020",5.0,the quality of sound when using them.,  Has very good sound quality and they connect automatically when put into the ears.
4130,"May 5, 2020",5.0,THEYRE REAL AIRPODS.,"  If you’re looking for real AirPods, you found them! They’re amazing."
4131,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Great Product,"  Apple is expensive, but my teenage son loves them and uses them all of the time for running, workouts and just relaxing."
4132,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Happy customer,  Best headphone investment I have ever made this far
4133,"May 5, 2020",1.0,Ehh,  Did not sink at right time
4134,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Great for the price,  I ordered a refurbished pair of these a while back and not only did they come looking brand new they sounded amazing and were ready to use. I know the sound quality on these are very mid but they are very convenient to use with my iPhone Xr and the battery life on these are long and take little time to charge. would definitely recommend!
4135,"May 5, 2020",4.0,Good product but?,  Good ear buds but they wouldn't stay in my ears.
4136,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Great product,  I love my air pods . However the shipping was a little long
4137,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great
4138,"May 5, 2020",2.0,Waste of money,  Junk. I bought these and they stopped working within 2 months. Tried contacting apple and they were unhelpful. Told me to go to a service center and then corona shut everything down so I'm left with junk
4139,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Not Brand New,  I love the Airpods. I do not like the fact that they were already named. Suggesting that someone else owned them before I received them. I wish they would tell us that upfront. I do not have time to return. They do work great.
4140,"May 5, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Great ear pods
4141,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Awesome,"  Birthday present for my boyfriend, he loves them"

4143,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Litty titty,  Dope got them as a gift
4144,"May 4, 2020",4.0,Legit Apple Product— Great Headphones,  Was so excited to receive these and at a great deal too! Yes they are a legit Apple product. Excellent quality headphones. Wasn’t sure if I would be into cordless headphones but I was totally wrong! Glad I purchased.Rated 4 stars for battery as one headphone was less charged than the other upon arrival (50% versus 80%).
4145,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Expensive but they work! Don’t buy a knock off!,  I bought a knock off before and the real thing is a HUGE difference. Great connectivity! Sounds clear during calls! Loads of bass! Great battery life!
4146,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Great gift,  Gift for my bf and he Love it
4147,"May 4, 2020",1.0,Keeps falling off your ear :(,  I don’t like it because it keeps falling off your ear
4148,"May 4, 2020",5.0,authentic,  Original

4150,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Legit,"  Legit. Don’t come with the adapter, but i’m sure you have one at home somewhere"
4151,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Perfect.,  Such an ease to connect and use. Came 75% charged and ready to go.
4152,"May 4, 2020",2.0,Not Worth It,"  I’ve had these since March 24th and to be perfectly honest, they’re not that great. They connect seamlessly to Apple products and are quick to charge- that’s about it. They fall out of my ears constantly (which is annoying considering the original wired headphones that Apple included with their phones fit perfectly- I had high hopes for these since the ear piece looks similar), they oftentimes won’t play whatever it is i’m listening to so I have to reconnect, and lastly, one ear bud seems to have a longer battery life than the other. So unless I received a defective pair, I wouldn’t bother with these. I’ll likely be sticking with my Beats."
4153,"May 4, 2020",3.0,Not reliable after a month,  One ear stopped working after 1 month and 4 days.
4154,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Works well for me,  I’m pretty pleased with these AirPods. I wasn’t expecting greatness I just wanted to be able to listen to music while I charged my phone. It works great for what I need it too. It doesn’t work well with non Apple products though so don’t  get these if you want to use them for that. At first I had trouble with the right air pod losing battery quicker and disconnecting while in use but that problem went away pretty quick. I like them a lot but it really is just headphones without cords so don’t expect much more.
4155,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Perfect AirPods,  Excellent product as bought at Apple store. They are like new!!!!
4156,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods,  Wonderful product I love them I recommend buying them

4158,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Does the job!,  Great quality!
4159,"May 4, 2020",2.0,***LOUD*** calendar alerts may damage hearing and no way to adjust volume,"  The loudness of calendar alerts is a deal-breaker.  It is maximum volume and seriously likely to damage your hearing and/or give you a heart attack.  When the alert goes off you claw at your skull to rip these out of your ears it is that bad.  I have thrown them across the room.This is a known bug with these.I researched this for days and the best i found was one method to adjust volume (kill all apps, reduce volume, use as normal( but as soon as you adjust the volume through a different app or on another set of Bluetooth speakers, it goes back to maximum.There is no practical way to control this.If you use your Airpods and phone for business and have a lot of calendar alerts, the Airpods suck.On the positive side, the sound is pretty good.They also charge very rapidly in the case - very pleasantly surprised at that.  I get about 4 - 5 charges from the case's battery before that has to be recharged.The feature for checking the battery on your iPhone by opening the case near the phone is also very cool.If they could fix the calendar bug they would be 5/5 rated."
4160,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Works great,  Works great
4161,"May 4, 2020",5.0,Go ahead y’all,  Yasss!!! And it came the same day before 6pm
4162,"May 4, 2020",4.0,Good!!,  The battery life is okay But could be better. The case however has a long battery life and is great. I recommend getting these from amazon but purchasing the Apple care plan to be safe. Received quick with prime as well
4163,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Definitely a great buy and worth it

4168,"May 3, 2020",1.0,Don’t Buy,  I bought these last year around Black Friday and now the sound is out in one pod and it won’t stay connected to my iPhone
4169,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Absolutely stoked on these!!,"  Holy cow! Fast shipping, fast all around. Super pumped!! Honest moment...I was a skeptic getting actual Apple Airpods. So, me being me, purchased a third party brand (not going to name). Was super disappointed in them and my roommate even told me ""They aren't going to compare"", well damn, she was right haha But seriously, without a doubt, just splurge and buy these. You don't even need to get this version, get the generation before these if that's the case. Just DO NOT get knock offs."

4177,"May 3, 2020",1.0,Can’t find a decent pair of blue tooth ear buds,  Worked perfectly for the first two days. Then after that the sound started cutting in and out and was static-y. Called Apple and they are sending out a replacement so hopefully those work. For over a year now I have been looking for a good quality blue tooth headset (ear buds preferred) and I have yet to find any that have worked without constantly disconnecting or having static.

4186,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Love it!!!,  My daughter loves this. She enjoy the features of the charging case.

4188,"May 3, 2020",1.0,Received defective product.,  Product came defective. The seams on the ear pierce are not flush and dirty in some areas. Sending this back.
4189,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Great!,"  My son talked me into buying AirPods. They seemed kind of superfluous. An expensive and possibly of limited value item. But I liked the idea of getting a greater range of uses with my Apple Watch.Now I don’t go anywhere without them. They sync with my watch in a few seconds. I now listen to more podcasts and have made numerous phone calls with great ease. I use them with my iPhone when I want to listen to music without disturbing anyone. When I walk my dog, I use one pod so that I can walk her safely, and I find that to be quite satisfactory. The design is wonderful and functional. The case feels solid and is easy to carry in pants pockets. Finally, the sound quality is outstanding, far exceeding my expectations. They’re not cheap, but you have to pay a little more for such an exemplary product."
4190,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Good quality,  It’s a nice product. Battery could last long the only complain is the pairing with multiple devices.... doesn’t work as expected. My gf bought an adapter for running.
4191,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Love these!,"  I've had these for 5 months now and can't get enough! So glad I purchased these, I'll never go back to regular headphones!"
4192,"May 3, 2020",5.0,Great Sound Quality & Battery Life,  I love these AirPods they are the best and the battery life last long !
4193,"May 3, 2020",5.0,"Love these, great purchase!!","  These are awesome! I use them all the time, love them!"
4194,"May 3, 2020",4.0,Does not work good at all for speak texting,"  Worked well for conversation but when I went to use for speak texting the device would always hesitate, be way behind with my words and most of the time present incorrect words and odd comments. Tried multiple adjustments to fix issue with no result. Not a good product when I can spend 1/3 of the price for other brands and get a better quality outcome. This is my first real disappointment with Apple."
4195,"May 3, 2020",5.0,The gift,  This product was a gift. The receiver of the gift called me using this product. Sound is very good and the receiver of the gift loved it.Thank you.
4196,"May 3, 2020",1.0,Right one dies faster,  The right one dies faster than the left one and charges slower too.
4197,"May 3, 2020",5.0,So good had to buy one for the wife.,  This is great here’s the run down:Earbuds last about 4-5 hours nonstop use. Takes about 30min for at least 50-60% charge in the case. The case itself last for days before u need a charge. I think I went a week. Mind you I work 5 days a week 8hours. Sitting at a desk in front of a computer. I have the time to use it lol. Calls are amazing great sound. I have had no issues running with them everyone’s ears are different so if u run and u don’t use the regular iPhone headphones then this is not for u or you may have to get the ear grips. But if your looking for a good wireless headset and willing to spend some cash get these.
4198,"May 2, 2020",1.0,Did not receive my air pods,  I did not receive my Apple AirPods.
4199,"May 2, 2020",4.0,One of the best,  earbuds that I've used.  My biggest issue is they are just too expensive for what they do.
4200,"May 2, 2020",5.0,great headphones,  never was one for the airpods but needed them since I ended up getting a new phone and the wire can get kind of annoying when working out.
4201,"May 2, 2020",1.0,FAKE,"  These aren't real apple airpods. I didn't see any thing wrong with the packaging but when I turn my head they cut out. If I have my phone in my back pocket they cut out. After having them for a couple months the name in my bluetooth settings went from ""airpods"" to a bunch of symbols, question marks and numbers and it took me about 10 minutes to get them reconnected."
4202,"May 2, 2020",1.0,Not worth the money...,"  They were good when I first got them, but 6 months later, lo and behold, the case stopped charging and the headphones themselves won't connect to my phone. Why am I paying this much for a pair that won't work for longer than 6 months?"
4203,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Apple AirPods,  Love them ! They are awesome
4204,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  Good just don’t drop them I broke them easily

4208,"May 2, 2020",4.0,Good sound,  My wife loves them she says you have to get used to them at first they are a bit uncomfortable but other than that they are a solid buy
4209,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Good Fit,"  Its a good fit, Did try some other brands but this was easy setup and easy fit. Charging case it really awesome and nice and small."

4211,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Love them,  I’ve been contemplating buying these for awhile and went through with it a few day’s ago. Just got them today so my review is only based off of an hour of use. But they’re great in my opinion 🤷🏼‍♀️
4212,"May 2, 2020",5.0,LOVE THIS,  I love everything about them. Best money I’ve spend!
4213,"May 2, 2020",4.0,Excellent Headphones if you use Apple products!,  Love how these pair with my iPhone and Apple Watch seamlessly!

4217,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Muy buenos
4218,"May 2, 2020",4.0,Es buena opción,  Lo único que no me gusta es que cuando usas uno solo no se oye tan claro
4219,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Apple air pods,  Great as expected. Probably the top of the line in ear buds.
4220,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Muy rapido el envio,  Muy bonitos
4221,"May 2, 2020",1.0,Received an empty box!!!!,"  Completely unacceptable!!! I ordered these AirPods and when I opened the package I immediately noticed that the apple packaging was compromised! It didn’t have the plastic seal that apple puts on ALL their products, instead it had a piece of tape on the bottom holding the box together which was the first red flag because the description said it was a NEW PRODUCT. When I removed the tape and opened the box the AirPods and charging case were not in the box!!!"
4222,"May 2, 2020",5.0,The love story,"  I love the sound, the way they work, I love everything. I am completely in love with these."
4223,"May 2, 2020",1.0,Waxy,"  I bought these “new” from apple on amazon and they came open, and used, and covered in earwax. Thanks amazon"
4224,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Fits ears perfect,  Love these AirPods can’t hear anything besides my music when I’m wearing them. I love them.
4225,"May 2, 2020",5.0,Just buy em if you like em,  It’s AirPods nothing else to it and they are not used as other reviews say they were sealed off in a wrap and have no visible sign of use
4226,"May 1, 2020",5.0,A must have for work if you don’t have to talk to people.,  These make my job much more enjoyable. Can’t understand how I worked without them.
4227,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Gift,  It was a perfect gift
4228,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Excellent,  Just as advertised
4229,"May 1, 2020",5.0,easy setup,"  sooo easy to set up.. i bought cheap airpods and had to return them, because they wouldnt charge.. spent the extra money and i am very glad i did.."
4230,"May 1, 2020",5.0,good,  like them
4231,"May 1, 2020",4.0,One ear is not working SEE UPDATE,"  So so very disappointed only the left ear worked. I trouble shoot with Apple . Reset, did all that I could possibly do and nothing in the right ear. Now I have to wait 5 days for the replacement. Beyond upset.Update: it took a while... I did get a perfect replacement and I am happy with them. They work perfectly"
4232,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Sooo happy!!!,  Everything I expected it to be ❤️
4233,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Great product and price,  Love these  the sound is amazing.
4234,"May 1, 2020",5.0,It’s good and if you want it get it,  It’s good just don’t get water like my kid did 😂 and it the real thing and sounds great and get a case bc you will drop it if you got butter hands
4235,"May 1, 2020",2.0,Right ear bud didn’t work,"  So this is my first ever purchase of AirPods and I’ve tried others before and totally wasted a pair so I finally did it and got some they got here and for starters it was delivered to my neighbors house. Then I open then and out the right one in and it doesn’t work at all. I did everything the internet told me to, to try and fix them and reset them and still nothing. I’m pretty upset but am getting a replacement hopefully they will work this time."
4236,"May 1, 2020",4.0,Ear pods,  Nice product but battery life is short
4237,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Quality,  It was nice and original.
4238,"May 1, 2020",5.0,These are the best,  I love my air pods
4239,"May 1, 2020",1.0,"Defective, Dangerous!","  DO NOT BUY THESE AIRPODS!! After 10 mins of use, the left pod started to heat up causing ear pain. After using right pod for 30 mins, I got severe headache. Called the Apple support for help. They put me on hold for 30 mins, transferred the call from one department to another. Finally the supervisor lady said she can’t do anything since the return window has expired. Waste of time and money! I have stopped using these and back to the wired headphones."
4240,"May 1, 2020",3.0,"Good, if you don’t like your music blasting in your ears",  The wired Apple earphones where louder than these and sensitive distance btwn phone and EarPods. Sometimes the EarPods screen did not pop up on phone even tho I was holding them both in my hand.
4241,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Worth every penny,  I am so glad I finally ordered these. The clarity is unbelievable. They have fallen out of my ears a few times so I did order a harness for when I am out.
4242,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Best little headphones,"  If I could befriend headphones, these would be the ones.  They're intuitive, easy to use, sound great, and worth the price now that I've had them a year and go nowhere without them.  I usually use one at a time so I can still hear around me and save on battery.  I've rarely dropped, but the couple of times I have, they've been just fine.  I love how easy they are to use with iPhone, MacBook, iMac.  They charge fast! I've not tried the pros, don't see any reason at this time because these fit comfortably and are so amazing!  I tried knock offs twice before these and am so glad I dropped that nonsense and bit the bullet on these higher priced, but oh so superior, headphones. I didn't think wires were a big deal until I moved to these and then tried to use the wired headphones once. Yuk. Almost pulled my MacBook right off the table. Goof. The case is slippery smooth; I would absolutely recommend a case of choice (I have Spongebob). Enjoy!"
4243,"May 1, 2020",5.0,"Sounds Great, may loose one if you're a really active person.",  Great Sound for all types of music if its been recorded right. And They're worth it because they stay connected. This is my Third pair because I Always loose one (right/left) from falling out my ear. I drive Tow Trucks and use Air pods for answering call ($500.00 Fine for Commercial vech. if get caught driving with phone near your ear.). Amazon sells small ear adaptors for Air pods ($2.00-$10.00). Think its time for me to invest in a couple of those adaptors.  Thanks
4244,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Super sound,"  How can you not like , comfortable to wear"
4245,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Be Wary of Used AirPods,"  I’ve had these AirPods since April 18th. They are legitimately some good AirPods. I don’t recommend getting them used because you’re  really testing your luck because previous owner could swap the AirPods (you could have a real case, but fake AirPods). But if you want to check if they are fake, check for magnets. If the AirPods push away from each other, they are real."
4246,"May 1, 2020",5.0,AirPods still the best,"  Went for the 2nd gen as opposed to the hard to locate, and more expensive latest gen. These work perfectly and suit me for what I do, the only continued struggle with these head phones is around the use of them for high impact workouts, they simply will not stay in my ears with so much movement. I do not see it as a criticism they work  fine for the most part, so for me they were the perfect purchase."
4247,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Love the smart Apple AirPod,  Love this product!!! So smart and convenience to use. Should buy a over to protect the lovey case.
4248,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Worth it,  Came in quick bought for my 9 year old he loves them
4249,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Well worth it,  What a difference between these and the off brand ones I was using! Well worth the money!
4250,"May 1, 2020",1.0,Falls out my ears,  I wanted to like this but unfortunately they keep falling out my ears. I'm returning them. I just know I'll loose them.
4251,"May 1, 2020",4.0,AirPods,  Great sound quality not so sure on battery life though
4252,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Worth the Money!!!,"  Never knew or understood how much my corded earbuds got in the way during my workouts until I purchased these!!  Its like a whole new world!  Sound quality is fantastic, no cord getting in the way while running or working out, and both the airpods and charging case charge quickly.  The range of the bluetooth is amazing as well.  i left my phone on my living room couch and was outside washing the car and the music and phone calls continued to work!!  Excellent product and definitely worth the money is you work out or run!!"
4253,"May 1, 2020",5.0,Great purchase,  These are original AirPods. My granddaughter is very happy with them.
4254,"May 1, 2020",1.0,it appears fake,"  I have been long time customer of Apple products and  I always buy them at the apple store, however, with current situation, I bought the air pods through Amazon. First time in my life that the prodcut is defective,the battery case didn't work. Consequently, I returned them and order them directly from the Apple Store. I had to pay a little bit more, however, I am sure I am getting the real product. Buyer be aware."
4255,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Worth it! Been needing these!!!,  I’m so happy I was able to buy these! Especially at a great price! My other ones got stolen from my car and they were a gift. So I saved up and waited to buy a new pair. Love them! Perfect!!
4256,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Great product,"  Amazing, will definitely recommend this product to others. Actually already have. Great Quality"
4257,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Love this,  Air pods are amazing. The sound is crisp and clear. The mic on the AirPods is top notch. All of my calls so far have been excellent. I like this more than my wireless Bose Soundsport.
4258,"April 30, 2020",1.0,I paid for new not used.,  Just bought another set and I received Kristen’s AirPods. Not new air pods like I paid for...
4259,"April 30, 2020",5.0,It's with the money,  Best investment ever!
4260,"April 30, 2020",5.0,no more wires!,  looks great and works as expected. no issues at all. charges so fast in the case. no more wires for me :)
4261,"April 30, 2020",5.0,great !!,  an amazing gift for my boyfriend he loved it
4262,"April 30, 2020",2.0,Right AirPod barely any sound coming out. Two month quality,"  Had these for just a bit over two months and one of AirPods barely has sound coming out of it. For almost $150 and a month return policy, very disappointing! Wish the company would replace."
4263,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Work great. Legit product.
4264,"April 30, 2020",5.0,"Fine product.  I’ll probably lose one in the future but that’s not the manufacturer’s fault, lol.",  Very nice.
4265,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  The sound quality is very good. They fit snuggly in the ear.
4266,"April 30, 2020",1.0,Scratched earpods,  The product came scratched and with a red mark on the right earpod. They were clearly not new earpods.
4267,"April 30, 2020",1.0,NO AIRPODS PRESENT!,"  would help more with a review if i’d actually received airpods not just an empty box. my advice to anyone wanting airpods , order directly from apple or go to a store. Amazon employees seem to have sticky fingers when it comes to popular items."
4268,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Best microphone,  Best wireless headphones out there. Amazing for phone calls in noisy areas.
4269,"April 30, 2020",1.0,DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE - BUY YOUR ELECTRONICS ELSEWHERE!,"  The wired charging case would not charge the airpods - so totally defective product because I have no way to charge the air pods. They were nice for the 2 days they lasted. I purchased pre-COVID, but missed the return window due to homeschooling children while also working from home and not having time. Amazon could care less about selling a defective product. Buy your electronics elsewhere with better response for selling defective merchandise."
4270,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Was skeptical about ordering because of reviews,  Was skeptical because of reviews but came brand new and they’re working great I love them.
4271,"April 30, 2020",2.0,The ear Poids fall out of my earsFall out of my ears,  I bought these ear pods a few months ago.I cannot safely use them as they continue to fall out of my earrs.  Particularly the left EarDo you have any suggestions?Sheila
4272,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Wish a charge lasted longer,  The head phones are decent but expensive. My only concern is the length of time you get using the head phones on a single charge. It seems like they last an hour.
4273,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Amazing!! I can’t live without my AirPod. Perfect
4274,"April 30, 2020",1.0,One stopped wotking,"  About a month after I purchased and a week after the return date, one pod stopped working and now I cannot return it."

4276,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Great product,  My kid loves them
4277,"April 30, 2020",1.0,"Paid for ""New,"" Received ""Refurbished""","  As an early Mother's Day gift, I decided to purchase my grandma a pair of AirPods as she had wanted them for the longest. After the package was delivered and she opened the box, the AirPods were clearly used and came with a ""Renewed"" information card. As a result, I wasted no time returning the item back. Stop with the false advertising."
4278,"April 30, 2020",1.0,Fake not real apple product,"  Less than one month after I bought this item it is not working well. It will unpaired itself. I bought this on February 24 today is April 30th and its only one ear that is working the other is not working. I think this earbuds are not from Apple, they are fake."
4279,"April 30, 2020",5.0,A step up from tethered ear buds.,  Great quality.  Price was on the high side.  Battery life is not as good as I hoped.  I will search out a different manufacture when these die.
4280,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  I’ve had these over a year now and they are still like new. High quality!
4281,"April 30, 2020",5.0,.,  I love the produce best decision ever. The delivery and the purchase was awesome and effective.
4282,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Yayyy!!,  Happy I received it. I really needed these for when my phone charges and i couldn’t use my regular earphones at the same time. Also to discreetly listen to music while at work hahaha ❤️
4283,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Cheaper,  Cheaper
4284,"April 30, 2020",1.0,Worse quality,  I purchased few months ago. Now my left one is not working. Very fake and worse quality.
4285,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Excellent sound quality.,  This product is the best by far. I love the sound and the extra features that comes with it. It can find my iPhone if I can’t find it. I bought it as a gift for my son then I bought myself a different and cheaper brand for myself and I was disappointed. I m buying myself one of this ones
4286,"April 30, 2020",5.0,comfortable,  I like these headphones. They are comfortable and easy to setup. Great Buy.
4287,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Wonderful product all in all
4288,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Bought for a gift for my boyfriend,"  He had been wanting them because he is a name brand whore and works out everyday so wireless just made sense. He absolutely loves them and they fit him pretty good. He is pretty content with them and somehow hasn't lost them yet so that's a plus. They rarely fall out and they sound pretty good, and he has never had a pairing problem with his iphone."
4289,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Original,  Original apple airpods
4290,"April 30, 2020",5.0,Apple,  These are the real Apple Airpods. They Doesn’t fall out the ear fits snugly. The sound is great & charging time is normal doesn’t go dead quickly ❣️

4294,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Worth getting the real thing,"  Bought cheaper knock offs before these and got what I paid for.  My son couldn't get bluetooth to connect without holding his phone to the pods in his ear.  These were worth it, work great, charge well, and he loves them."

4296,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Works great!,  Best Christmas gift for a great friend! They loved them. Can't stop talking about the sound and quality. Received before time. Item as pictured. Will do business with you again.

4298,"April 29, 2020",1.0,Do NOT buy!,  Just buy at an Apple store.  I keep hearing clicking noises while I have them on.  Do not buy from here.  I eventually thought if I forgot the device and added it back to my phone it would go away but it’s so annoying I wish I could return or exchange them.
4299,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Amazing quality,  Amazing product!
4300,"April 29, 2020",5.0,A must for hands free,  Love the hands free
4301,"April 29, 2020",5.0,"Dog Ate My AirPods, They Still Work!","  Didn’t think much of these until my pit bull terrier got a hold of them while I was in the bathroom. He chewed them to the brink of death then pooped them out later. Surprisingly, these headphones are stronger than infinity stones bc they still work and tbh better than when I bought them. I’m not suggesting letting your dog eat them but I am saying they are 5x louder and charge faster now."
4302,"April 29, 2020",1.0,Airpods,  Mi producto no fue recibido

4304,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Don't buy fakes,"  Having owned both real and fake airpods, I can say having real ones is just so much easier and the quality is much better. Would definitely recommend buying real if you are unsure what you want"
4305,"April 29, 2020",5.0,worth it,  very happy
4306,"April 29, 2020",1.0,Arrived broken,"  My package arrived without any bubble wrap or protective packing. When I opened the case everything was completely strewn about. The airpods were out of the box and the rest of the packaging was spread around. The Airpods themselves are not functioning and I tried troubleshooting with a technician. It's probably because they've been rattled around the box for the last couple of days, but I can't be sure. In addition, there was no charging cable in the box. It doesn't look like it could have fallen out, so I think it was never in there. Not happy about this one."
4307,"April 29, 2020",5.0,The product was amazing,"  Amazing!!! I receive the product really fast, it was new in the package. I recomended 100%"
4308,"April 29, 2020",3.0,Great call quality but fit is not for everyone...,"  Really enjoyed the quality of calls, sound and convenience of quick pairing and switching between devices however while the fit was great on one ear, wasn't the same for the other one. Kept falling, had to return. No way of knowing how it will fit without trying on, therefore experience with them differs from person to person. Take these reviews here with a grain of salt."
4309,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Real good fidelity,  Excellent
4310,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Airpods 2,  Top of the line wireless earpods.

4312,"April 29, 2020",1.0,Multiple issues with the Airpods,  Bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas 2019. Sound quality is not good on one side and the battery seems not to charge any more. Very disappointed. Window of time to return was only 30 days. We are stuck with a $130 item that no longer functions.
4313,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Apple 🍎 is nice,  This item is great people were rating bad and saying not apple 😂 this product is great it’s excellent plus it save me 69 dollars plus gas money from going to the store purchasing these for 160 plus tax
4314,"April 29, 2020",5.0,Worth the money,  My son loves these and has actually been very responsible with them !
4315,"April 29, 2020",1.0,DOA Twice So Far!,"  I got these for my birthday from my wife. The case would not charge, so I worked with support for 3 hours and they sent me a replacement case. The new case would not pair on any phone or iPad, so I spent 2 more hours on the phone and they are sending me a whole new set. I have yet to experience a working set, so I am only giving this product one star. I also figure that with the deposits they require for the replacements and the cost of the item itself, Apple currently has about $500 of my money. I will say that I should get the replacement deposits back, but I am having a really bad experience with this product."

4326,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Awesome sound and easy to use,"  Sound, fit and size are perfect! They are better than I expected. I use them while out and about and running. I would recommend the AirPod pros for running though, these tend to slip a bit."
4327,"April 28, 2020",1.0,NA,  Product was defective
4328,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Loved them!,  These are such a great pair of headphones! They work perfectly and are good as knew.
4329,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Apple quality!,"  Great value for Apple iPods, can’t go wrong at this price."
4330,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Another fantastic Apple product,  Only problem I had was the left side keeps falling out my ears a few times. Tested on Iphone 6s
4331,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Product is legitimate,  Got it brand new
4332,"April 28, 2020",1.0,EMPTY BOX,"  Very disappointed, bought this for my wife and the box is empty. No headphones or charging case. The box was still sealed upon delivery."
4333,"April 28, 2020",1.0,Bad business,  I just received my package. to look inside unpackage the pods in the find out that there is nothing there is no charging case and there is no pods.
4334,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Fast delivery,  Excellent
4335,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Hermosos😍,  Muy buena calidad
4336,"April 28, 2020",1.0,Absolutely horrible,"  Absolutely horrible experience with both the product and the shipping. For starters, I pay for prime membership, and didn’t get the package until around two weeks after I reported that my original package never arrived.Now my AirPod case won’t charge my AirPods after less than one year of owning it! I always took care of the case, bought a protector for it, only ever used compressed air to clean it, and always clipped it into my waist. There is absolutely zero reason that it should have stopped working. Save yourself the time and don’t buy the product, it’s a dud. They’re sucking your money out of your wallet and giving horrible quality in return. Now my AirPods are useless and they’ll charge $70 just for another dud of an AirPods case."
4337,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  Don’t buy from amazon my left AirPod doesn’t go loud anymore and I barely use them at all. Very upset.
4338,"April 28, 2020",5.0,There’s very loud and comfortable. Yes and very nice and matches with everything,  These Apple AirPods from generation are my second pair they are very nice they’re very small very compact they are easy to travel or easy to take anywhere and they’re very cute They are stillish with long hair unnotaicable to i can use them in school love 5 out of 5.

4341,"April 28, 2020",5.0,2nd pair as a gift,  They work great !
4342,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  Was really excited for wireless earbuds. I have small ears and earphones and earbuds easily fall out of my ear if I don’t jam them in. These are so comfy and I do not find myself adjusting them as much because of the design. I bought air pods because I found it hard to work out with my wire ones. They sound great and they stay on throughout my hour workout. I recommend them and I am glad I got them. Battery will last me about 3-4 hours without charging in between and the AirPod charges the earbuds really quickly while maintaining a good amount of charge for itself.
4343,"April 28, 2020",1.0,Not Happy!,"  My AirPods won’t connect to my MacBook and i can not get a hold of Apple to try to resolve. I’ve made sure they are updated, they connect to my phone but I bought them specifically for my job and to be on video calls all day and they won’t connect. Needless to say I am not happy. Because of the pandemic I cannot get a hold of Apple either to try to get some support. I feel like I’ve wasted my money!"
4344,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Definitely worth buying,  Really like this and are worth the money.Good sound quality barely use and battery and can last more than a day straight of use with no charge.Small and carry anywhere especially with a case wont be disappointed when you receive them.Had them for over 3 months now and still like brand new
4345,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Legit AirPods,  Real Legit legit airpods
4346,"April 28, 2020",2.0,not worth the money,  the day i got it and i was told it sounds like im in a fishtank LMAO how is that even possible dont really like the idea of sounding like that one kid in the lobby who has music blasting through their mic with the worst quality ever
4347,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,  I love them! Couldn’t have asked for anything better!
4348,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Bluetooth airpods,"  Easy, good battery life, stay in ears pretty well"

4350,"April 28, 2020",5.0,Great purchase!,"  Came with no protection around the box, but they were almost fully charged and work perfectly!"
4351,"April 28, 2020",1.0,"short lifespan , lose sound quality and performance in a couple months","  These only lasted a few months. Considering the cost they should last a much longer time.I couldn't get customer service to help, so,  I'm out of luck"

4357,"April 27, 2020",5.0,love them,  just what I was expecting
4358,"April 27, 2020",1.0,I need to get a label to return the item and re-purchase them or do an exchange,  I have to return my iPad because they don’t work one of the pairs

4368,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Can't go wrong with Apple,"  I purchased a cheap brand ($40), but Apple is worth the price.  The AirPods easily connect to Apple computer, phone and battery charge is displayed on either device."
4369,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Great headphones!,  Bought for my son for Christmas! He loves them. No complaints.
4370,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Phenomenal sound quality and very comfortable to wear!,"  Absolutely remarkable. The sound quality is phenomenal and the noise cancellation is excellent. The AirPods themselves are comfortable and have an excellent battery life, as does the case. Charging is quick and efficient. I’m beyond thrilled that I finally picked up a pair."
4371,"April 27, 2020",5.0,The quality and results you would expect!,  What’s not to like!!!!!
4372,"April 27, 2020",1.0,Don’t work!!!,  One of the pods is cracked. I bought these in April and hardly even used and the case won’t charge. Don’t buy these!
4373,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Great quality and sound,"  Hated Apple for years but I'm glad I switched.All their products are very high quality including these headphones.Great sound, they work flawlessly with my iPhone 11 and Apple Watch 5."
4374,"April 27, 2020",5.0,They are real,  They are legit! I love them
4375,"April 27, 2020",2.0,Connection Issues,"  These are intuitive and sound great when they work as advertised.  Many reviews I read were about connection issues with one or both pods.  Since I received mine, the right pod either doesn't connect, doesn't connect right away or disconnects.  Took out Apple Care for this reason and glad I did.  They are replacing the right pod."
4376,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Perfect,"  Lasts years. Definitely worth it, I just got the new gen since I had the first gen for 2 and a half years and it still works which is crazy. Now I upgraded."
4377,"April 27, 2020",1.0,Broke in 2 months,  My right AirPod quit functioning properly 2 weeks in. Both quit working in 2 months and the sound got worse during that time. You just hear screeching sounds now
4378,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Good quality with good price from Amazon,"  The sound quality is better than I expected. If I knew it was this good, I would’ve gotten it right when it came out."
4379,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Good purchase,"  This is my second pair unfortunately my first got stolen, but they are really good when trying to remain lowkey and jam out."
4380,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Worth it!,  I LOVE these.  I am so glad I bought them.  Love being wireless!  So worth it!
4381,"April 27, 2020",2.0,Important,  It dies too fast does not last as long as it says it does
4382,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Sound,  Sound good and they are pretty
4383,"April 27, 2020",3.0,Half dont work and apple is no help,"  about a month into having these, using them every day the left one has stopped working. Apple is no help unless I want to buy a replacement. the charging case recognizes it but no sound out if the left and doesn't show up on the phone."
4384,"April 27, 2020",1.0,They stopped working after only three months!,  Purchased My Apple AirPods in December 2019 ( as a Christmas gift for myself) and now a few months later they are not working.  They stopped working in March 2020 ( so basically I had them for three months).  The sound in the right ear pod went out first and then the left side.  No one can hear me when I'm talking( sounds muffled and goes in and out).  So three months later and I have nothing.  Such a waist of money.
4385,"April 27, 2020",5.0,great headphones,  great headphones
4386,"April 27, 2020",5.0,love it!,  works perfect
4387,"April 27, 2020",3.0,Dissappointed,  The pods fall out of my ears constantly and the noise cancellation is practically non- existent. I am super disappointed.
4388,"April 27, 2020",3.0,Barely can hear out of these!!!,  Does not play loud
4389,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Authentic AirPods,  Easy to pair to my phone and checked serial number on Apple’s website to very they are authentic. Love them!
4390,"April 27, 2020",3.0,"Falls out during workouts, great sound quality","  Sound quality is really great, but does that matter when I’m exercising and the left one falls out and they stop playing?  Flat or incline chest press - left one out.  Abs - you better believe they fall out, etc etc.  So, my kid is taking these and I’m going back to my 4 year old mpow wired bluetooth which won’t fall out.  Bottom line, if you don’t do much physical activity and you just something while at your desk or just sitting or walking around these will be perfect."
4391,"April 27, 2020",1.0,DO NOT BUY THESE,"  The green light on these kept flashing, and when I tried to watch videos that might’ve resolved the issue the methods did not work. I’m begging you, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!! Just go ahead and buy these regular price from Apple!!!!"
4392,"April 27, 2020",5.0,Good gift,"  Noise reduction is nice, purchased as a gift"
4393,"April 27, 2020",4.0,Apple wireless ear buds.,  This is the third set I have bought. All were gifts for friends and relatives. They are of a high quality.
4394,"April 26, 2020",1.0,Stopped working after 2 months,  2 months exactly and they quit working. My son said one of his quit a week or so ago.
4395,"April 26, 2020",5.0,I love them!,"  My AirPods came fully sealed much like other apple products I’ve purchased, they feel heavier than a knock off brand I had before, so you know they are genuine and high quality, they work really well and paired with my iPhone really easily and quickly, I absolutely love them! I love that they pause the music when you take them out of your ear, and when they’re playing music they cancel out other sounds so well"
4396,"April 26, 2020",1.0,Don't buy.,  Had to order 2 replacements and they still don't work. Just buy from Apple or don't get them they are a waste of money.
4397,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Sound quality,  As good as apple products.
4398,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Gift good,  I bought  it for a boyfriend first a early bday gift. He loves them. The sound he loves

4408,"April 26, 2020",2.0,Not sure about these AirPods,"  I bough these fromAmazon back in late September and the left side AirPod is not working at all as of today, recharged them and reset them and still didn’t fix issue.  This is the problem I see buying from here versus going straight through Apple. Lesson learned."
4409,"April 26, 2020",1.0,Don’t buy,  Crap only got them worked a few hours then only 1 would work can’t even get an exchange
4410,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Great investment!,  Shipping was fast. It came brand new and ready to pair. My boyfriend loves his AirPods.

4414,"April 26, 2020",3.0,Don’t work well,  They don’t stay charge up long only for 3 hours ...How can I return them...???
4415,"April 26, 2020",5.0,This was a great buy at a great price. Highly recommend it.,"  These are absolutely nice. Great noice cancellation, loved the sound quality and its battery last longer than most EarPods I have used before. Highly recommend it."
4416,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Love my earbuds! They work great! Battery lasts.
4417,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Basically just like the wired headphones,  Love these and how easy they make everything! Not good for noise cancelling but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me.
4418,"April 26, 2020",5.0,The earpods are worth the price.,  Excellent product highly recommend.
4419,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Excellent,"  Airpods are so convenient.  They have great sound, fit well in my ear."
4420,"April 26, 2020",4.0,Well worth the $$$,"  I love these earbuds.  I have a few pair, and these make the others look like trash.  Pairing couldn’t be simpler, they are lightweight and super comfortable, fit well, and couldn’t be simpler to use.  These are great earbuds.The reason I only gave them a lower rSting is the sound quality.  It’s not bad, but it’s also pretty far from great.  The sound is nicely balanced, but lacks any punch.  They do sound amazing with a few albums, but that is rare.  The sound is usually flat and lacking dynamics.  Still, they sound good enough.Overall, though, I am happy.  I do recommend them, but with a caveat."
4421,"April 26, 2020",5.0,I love them. Absolutely love them.,  Period.
4422,"April 26, 2020",1.0,Don’t order,  I love these AirPods but the sound is not clear I going to return them I don’t think these are the right ones

4425,"April 26, 2020",5.0,Great!,"  No issues, my daughter loves them."
4426,"April 25, 2020",5.0,Like the design and quality,  Sound quality is good and it has noise cancellation at some extent as well. Love how it fits and does not move even when I am running. The only thing bothers me is the charging case does not sits. I guess its because it has charging port but Apple can do better.
4427,"April 25, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  Pretty good I use them all the time
4428,"April 25, 2020",3.0,Like them but got a lemon,  Right AirPod does not charge.  Have only been using it a week..  very frustrated
4429,"April 25, 2020",5.0,So convenient and user friendly!,"  LOVE! these AirPods. So much more convenient than wired ear buds and so easy to use. As soon as you pop one in, your audio goes directly to the pod and as soon as you take it out it starts on the phone again. I use as a Bluetooth while driving (and with Siri, it is so easy to make calls and perform other functions, totally hands free.) Not to mention, the sound quality is very good, and easily adjustable. Also use for music, podcasts, YouTube videos, etc. and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I have used them a lot more than I thought I would."
4430,"April 25, 2020",5.0,worth the money!,"  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase the airpods, and I love them! Easy to take around with me, great audio quality, and nice battery life! I was unsure to get them or not, but I'm glad I did! So awesome for music and videos! Arrived very quickly and couldn't be more satisfied!! would reccomend!! The originals do just an amazing job, even though they have been released for quite a while, still worth it!!"

4440,"April 25, 2020",1.0,Stopped charging the right airpod after 3 months of use - even with cleaning,"  I bought these airpods for my husand for Christmas. When they arrived, they already looked like they had a little dirt in them. After 3 months of use, the right airpod stopped charging and working. The only recomendations Apple has is to clean them with a cotton swab. We did this multiple times and it still won't charge. It's not the actual airpods because they charge in my case, but not his. A new charging case is $70. I am so frustrated they only lived 3 months."
4441,"April 25, 2020",5.0,love,  Love
4442,"April 25, 2020",5.0,Love them!,"  My daughter begged for these for Christmas and we were reluctant. We splurged and got them for her. She loves them, and uses them all the time and now everyone in the family borrows them from her. I've used them for running and other workouts and they are great. They are easy to set up and have worked with all our apple and android devices. Now I'm thinking of buying some for myself. They are worth the cost."
4443,"April 25, 2020",5.0,Best quality I’ve experienced in a wireless earbud option.,  Love my AirPods! They work great. Used them on a flight while watching Netflix and I couldn’t have been more happy. The size is a little large for my ears. But working on a solution. Love them! Definitely recommend!!

4445,"April 25, 2020",4.0,Love apple but charging is weird,"  Love them and I will be an Apple fan for life. The only issue with these is sometimes they charge weird. One day I was in the gym and my left ear bud stoped working. They were fully charged before I left that morning then got to the gym and it wouldn’t work- just the left one, the right one worked fine. I put it back in the charging pod and sure enough 0% charge.Weirdest thing, this has happened to me now 4 times."
4446,"April 25, 2020",5.0,She loves them,  I got these for my wife after trying a disappointing knock off product.  She loves these!  Should have known to stick with Apple products.
4447,"April 25, 2020",2.0,Left Airpod Out.,"  I was so frustrated to realize that the left airpod wasn’t working at all, and then I read the reviews to see that other people had the exact same problem. The charging case and right side work fine, but I’m stuck with one airpod. It came in this way - one airpod out."
4448,"April 25, 2020",5.0,Love these!!!!!,"  These AirPods changed my life!! As a mother of 2 under 2, these were heaven sent!! I can easily listen to music all day long and my kids cant tell! Phone calls and voice dictation for texting is amazing! It works great with my appleWatch too!"

4460,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Just what I wanted and nice price.,  Perfect fit!
4461,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Honestly amazing,  Was tired of waiting for the Google Buds 2; these are absolutely amazing and I don't think they could be better for the price! (This is also the only apple product I have)
4462,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Amazing!,  Sounds great!
4463,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  I love them
4464,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Recommend,  Grandsons favorite Christmas present
4465,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Great air pods,  Everything is great just figured it out
4466,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Nice and cute,  Perfect 👌🏽 I order this around 7am and they came in around 1 PM the shipment 📦 was fast!!
4467,"April 24, 2020",1.0,Where to get service,  The tapping feature does not work so I can’t answer or conclude calls.
4468,"April 24, 2020",1.0,not working after 3 months of use,  So I have had this airpods for 3 months and one of the pods is not working  getting someone to talk to is impossible and the support recommendation don't work.  Did factory reset 3 times and the one pod still does not work.  I guess I need to work on getting my money back since they are in warrenty but even that is difficult to figure out
4469,"April 24, 2020",4.0,Good but battery life sucks,  Like the AirPods just hate after 3hrs I’d listening they have to be recharged
4470,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Good Brand New and Sealed,"  I was a bit concerned by some of the other reviews, not sure if others were purchasing from other sellers, and receiving used items, but got mine and it was in a factory sealed box brand new, never used, or opened. Everything is good, happy with it"
4471,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Overpriced but works well and you’re in the club,"  This is a good product if a little overhyped. Comfort is good but not great. The sound is good but not great. The noise cancellation is very good. Used for the phone I usually only put one ear in and I’m told it sounds great and I can hear good.The only things - my trucker headset I can say answer phone and it does. This doesn’t, so I have to actually answer my phone and it will often switch out of airbud mode and go to phone for phone calls. I’m looking for hands free and this kinda fails on that one. And lastly, way overpriced."
4472,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Welll...,  Kinda upset with the fact that I paid for it to have a heart engraved on it and it didn’t come with it on there. Other than that I love it!
4473,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Great use!,"  Obsessed with my new AirPods, shipping was super fast and very helpful for runners."
4474,"April 24, 2020",2.0,They work for a couple months and then don't! Dont buy!!!,"  At first I was so happy with this product, they worked great and made working out at the gym much easier without having a cord hanging getting in the way. However, after a couple months the battery life deteriorated. Rarely do both of the headphones sync together. Usually I get one to work for about 5 minutes and then it dies again. I am so disappointed as I saved up to buy these thinking they would be a worthwhile investment and they are NOT.  I took very good care of them, didnt over use them and they still only lasted a couple months."
4475,"April 24, 2020",1.0,Lost one and Apple can’t recognize my serial number,  What’s wrong with Apple - im trying to buy a replacement and they say thay can’t find the serial number printed in Amazon’s invoice
4476,"April 24, 2020",5.0,Works GREAT,  These are absolutely amazing.
4477,"April 24, 2020",1.0,"Batteries not working properly, draining while in the case.","  Battery drains completely while being in the charging case and aren’t in use. I’ve had them since Monday. It’s Friday morning and both the earbuds and the case die while being “charging”Completely disappointed with the product and I would like a refund, I’ll return them if I have to. “Brand new” airpods should not be doing this."
4478,"April 24, 2020",5.0,They are great,  Hurts my ears but my husband loves his
4479,"April 24, 2020",5.0,good price. Got delivered in 3 days,  My son loves them
4480,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Great Sound!,"  OMG , what great sound! I had originally bought the Beats ear pods. While I love my Beats headphones, the ear pods sounded cheap, with poor sound. But these Apple ear pods are excellent!!! Not sure about the battery life, but I am using them right out of the box."
4481,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Very nice,  Great
4482,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Great item!,  Very good ty
4483,"April 23, 2020",5.0,"Wait, I can’t hear you 😂","  I listen to music and take calls on them, I just got them a day ago and I love them. Only annoying thing is when you take one out and it pauses the music but it’s helpful in a way.. but I still wanna here my music 😂 lol but it came awesome in the original packaging. I’ll give an updated review after some time goes by!"
4484,"April 23, 2020",5.0,"Best purchase I’ve made in years! Makes listening, talking so much easier without a cord!","  Live, love, love!"
4485,"April 23, 2020",1.0,Empty Box,"  There were no air pods inside, very disappointed."
4486,"April 23, 2020",1.0,Terrible battery life in one.,  The right AirPod will not stay charged. It dies very quickly. There is also static crackling when using them.
4487,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Perfection,  I’m blown away by the sound! They are so loud and don’t lose the quality sound when they are at max volume. I love the shape and light weight. These are exactly what I wanted! I’m an Apple lover already but man these are nice!
4488,"April 23, 2020",3.0,Low quality for price,  Good for running but volume doesn’t get loud enough for my liking. They are not noise canceling. Mine only last about 3 hrs per charge.
4489,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Pony up the money and buy these ones,  I drank the stupid juice and bought the $20 off-brand ones... twice. Save yourself the hassle of fighting with and ultimately returning your $20 crapphones; just buy these. They are better in every way.
4490,"April 23, 2020",5.0,No complaints,  Great
4491,"April 23, 2020",5.0,DO IT,"  So glad I pulled the trigger on these, worth it!"
4492,"April 23, 2020",5.0,AirPods,  They came on time I use them all the time and was a great purchase and saved me some money.
4493,"April 23, 2020",4.0,Good Headphones,"  I like them, but they aren't really noise cancelling. They also can get uncomfortable after a while."
4494,"April 23, 2020",5.0,I loved,  Llego muy rápido y me encantaron ya los quería desde hace mucho :)
4495,"April 23, 2020",1.0,stopped working in 4 months,  Don’t buy these. Had them for 4 months and they already stopped working!!

4501,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Excelente 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟,  Brutal
4502,"April 23, 2020",1.0,Only right ear works,  I bought these for my wife for Christmas. From the start the left ear pod would play music for 3 or 4 mins and then turn off. I have gone thru all their steps they say will correct it and still nothing. Look for a different option when buying ear buds.
4503,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Quality,  I love them!!! They’re perfect!!! 😍😍😍
4504,"April 23, 2020",1.0,Wrong generation listed.,  Was sold gen 1 AirPods when listing said it was gen 2.
4505,"April 23, 2020",4.0,Recommend,  They are pretty good but sometimes the sound will go in and out but disconnecting them will fix that.
4506,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Solid Purchase,"  I tried the amazon echo buds- hated them. Switched over to these and are much happier. Purchased directly from amazon, not 3rd party- verified that they were a valid apple product. A lot of people are complaining they are getting knock offs. Clean, brand new - over all - very satisfied."
4507,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Perfect AirPods!!!,  I LOVE them. They are exactly what I wanted and the sound in the AirPods are perfect. They were packaged very securely.
4508,"April 23, 2020",5.0,"Great sound, comfortable and secure fit!  He loves them.",  Christmas present for my son.  He had an older version and wanted to upgrade and especially liked a feature this version.
4509,"April 23, 2020",5.0,5 Stars!,  Love them!

4514,"April 23, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  Fits great feels great and sounds great
4515,"April 23, 2020",1.0,do not buy,  White light will not blink to sync device.
4516,"April 23, 2020",4.0,Good,  They cut out every once in a while. After unpausing something it goes through one ear bud and then cuts out and then goes through both. They might not have been worth all 140 dollars but they are pretty good. The battery life isnt bad. I work 12 hour shifts and they last a good while.
4517,"April 22, 2020",5.0,its a great product really great,  great product real apple not fake really recommend
4518,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Love it love it,  Omg I’m so happy I love it
4519,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Fun AirPods,  Dislike nothing and I like everything about the AirPods. They are also light weight which I love.
4520,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Very good,  Love these things!
4521,"April 22, 2020",4.0,Headphones - Pricey but still worth it,  Great headphones -  I bought them to talk on being a Realtor I spend a lot of time on the phone.  I also run with them.  Pretty versatile.  I recommend them -  price point sucks though.
4522,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Happy Customer!!! 😊😊,  My son had been wanting these for quite some time now & he absolutely loves them!!!
4523,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Great headphones,  Worth the money! These head phones are amazing! The battery life last long and they are legit!
4524,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Double check the address,  I have no complaints about the product. This package was delivered to a wrong house.
4525,"April 22, 2020",4.0,My AirPods,  My left AirPod doesn’t work properly
4526,"April 22, 2020",5.0,"Great quality, clean looking.",  This item comes fast and is cheaper than from the apple store. It is really good quality and great battery life.
4527,"April 22, 2020",1.0,Mercancía faltante - la caja vino vacía,  Compré este artículo en días anteriores y la caja blanca de apple me vino abierta y sin el producto. Necesito que me devuelvan mi dinero.
4528,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Recommend,  Loveeeee these so glad they were a bit cheaper than on the apple site. Thank you I so needed them !!!
4529,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Sound quality is great,  Works perfectly fine
4530,"April 22, 2020",5.0,sounds great,  All of the pieces where included.
4531,"April 22, 2020",4.0,great product,"  I purchased 2 sets of these, both work great and as expected.  I was a little weirded out that both of them had names connected to them already though. one said ""Dwayne the rock Johnsons AirPods"" the other ""bad b&#^$ AirPods""  other than that they were brand new with no marks and original packaging"
4532,"April 22, 2020",5.0,so worth the money :),"  I love my AirPods! They are very nice and so worth the price, they were delivered a lot earlier than expected which was great :)"
4533,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Well done,"  Since I no longer had the first version of this product (damaged), it was an easy choice in purchasing the v2 (wouldn't upgrade to these versions if i already have v1 due to minor differences). Fits in both ears perfectly fine. Not water-proof or sweat-proof, however, most people (myself included) do not have a problem running with them in my ear. Connects to all of my apple products with ease. Overall, really satisfied with the purchase."
4534,"April 22, 2020",5.0,AIRPODS,"  What can I say? They are AirPods and they are awesome. Buy them. This is my 3rd pair, I love them."
4535,"April 22, 2020",5.0,The best,  I really like them
4536,"April 22, 2020",4.0,Good quality,  Quality sound and easy to operate.

4538,"April 22, 2020",5.0,"Good product, Direct from Apple Store.",  Love it!
4539,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Surprising good sound quality,  You don’t know you need them until you buy them
4540,"April 22, 2020",5.0,I received my item early great that's my 13 year old birthday gift very satisfied,  Perfect my son loves it
4541,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Love them!,  Love them so glad I purchased them!!! A must buy!
4542,"April 22, 2020",4.0,If you have small ear holes....,"  I have very small ears apparently.  I have spent 100's of dollars trying to find a pair of headphones that work for me.. these are still not them.  If you have small ear holes these will fall out constantly.  So, I honestly hate using these so much... BUT, with all that being said, they are VERY comfortable.. they do not hurt my ears at.. again small ear holes, a lot of headphones start hurting within 30 minutes of wearing them.  The sound is REALLY good.  The convenience is the only reason I didn't return them.  The battery life lasts FOREVER..  I think I have charged them three times since I got them * I don't use them everyday*.  They connect really easily too.  If you have small ears hard pass but if you have normal ears then these are for you..  The best way to know if they will fit and stay in is to wear the ones the phone came with... exactly the same fit without the mess of a cord."
4543,"April 22, 2020",1.0,Disgusted,  Package arrived and the AirPods box was not sealed and only contained the literature for the AirPods! Absolutely disgusted that some amazon thieving fulfiller got a new pair of AirPods that were meant to be a birthday gift for my son.
4544,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Sound is great!,  These are great! They’re definitely real and they work really well. I was suspicious buying these online but they for sure work really well! And connect automatically. They came in brand new
4545,"April 22, 2020",1.0,airpods 2.,"  The parcel was not delivered. Information to whom they gave, who accepted at the request of the courier was not provided. In fact, there is no parcel."

4547,"April 22, 2020",1.0,Cheap Quality,  Disliked the cost for how cheaply these where designed...
4548,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Perfect conditions!,  Thanks all good!
4549,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Love these!,"  I am sooo happy with my purchase, I’ve waited 5 months to write a review because I noticed some people were complaining about them going out or disconnecting after only a few months, since owning them, I can confirm that my airpods have worked normal the entire time, no random disconnects or them just not working in general. They still work the same from the day I got them!"
4550,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Fast shipping and excellent product.,  Fast shipping and excellent product.
4551,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  Thanks
4552,"April 22, 2020",5.0,amazing!,  authentic item. they fit really well. i use them for running. i heard some people had trouble connecting to the phone but it was very easy and quick for mine. happy with this purchase!
4553,"April 22, 2020",5.0,Love !,"  I love this , didn’t take long to come even though we are in a pandemic. They were perfectly. Sound is great. & lasts for a while!"
4554,"April 21, 2020",5.0,Replacement pair for my last pair,"  Had my last pair for about two years and the battery just wasn't good anymore, they started dying after like a hour/hour and a half. New pair is great, I get 4-5 hours of battery time before I have to charge (takes 15 mins to full charge)."
4555,"April 21, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Works great
4556,"April 21, 2020",4.0,"Compact, sleek, great sound, and convenient battery life","  its nothing new to say that these are good headphones. I got these on sale for $130 on amazon compared to the standard $160. The price is somewhat extreme however. I get that it’s Apple, and the sound is great, but it is not $160 material. At the same time however, because of its compactness and solid battery life, these are a must for passionate music listeners"
4557,"April 21, 2020",5.0,It performs so good,"  Airpods are the most useful wireless earphones I have never meet. It's cool to get rid of the wire, and it's so easy to use. The battery life surprised me, I didn't expect it can work such a long time."
4558,"April 21, 2020",1.0,AirPods Box was empty,"  The shipping box was intact, but the AirPod box was empty!!! The only contents were the directions and manual.  The AirPod box was not wrapped in cellophane and appeared very rough. Very disappointed!"
4559,"April 21, 2020",3.0,Great in concept but not dependable  and too expensive.,"  Pros- These are so confortable and lightweight you will forget you are wearing them if there is no music on.- Music quality is fine- easy to pair- pretty long range (I walk away from my phone in the office about 30 ft and they still work fine.Cons- Super expensive for what you get- my battery life doesn't last longer then about 2 hours of calls. They have died during meetings before.- sometimes will say they are paired, but they will not function and I have to switch back to holding my phone.I wouldn't spend the money again. The convenience of the wireless doesn't outweigh the inconvenience of dying or refusing to connect during a meeting or important call."
4560,"April 21, 2020",5.0,Daughter loves them,  what can I say...they work
4561,"April 21, 2020",5.0,Great product,"  They fall out of my ears, but I’m just not used to them... The sound is wonderful..."
4562,"April 21, 2020",1.0,Apple,  There where no AirPods in the box
4563,"April 21, 2020",5.0,"Great price, making the future affordable",  Cant wait for the day where these come with the iPhone. Definitely will change your life using these. Apple always has the best quality items.
4564,"April 21, 2020",5.0,They were good quality,  They seem good my sister took them and walked away so I say they were perfect
4565,"April 21, 2020",5.0,I liked,"  Excellent, as described"
4566,"April 21, 2020",5.0,Great product,  My husband loves them and uses them all the time.
4567,"April 21, 2020",5.0,"Excellent convenience, sound quality, battery and design make airpods worth the price!","  Love these!Bought multiple sets for the entire family! The sound quality of the 2nd generation airpods has certainly improved from the 1st generation. The sound is still crisp, but the ""bass"" is greatly enhanced. This brings the new generation nearly up to the five-star level of earbuds like the $300 Stennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2.Apple's airpods aren't built for complete noise cancellation. Although the ear-form shape of Apple's airpods help prohibit background noise somewhat, if you're looking for complete noise cancellation you'd be better served looking for earbuds designed for that purpose, like the $228 Sony WF-1000XM3. However, if you're like me and don't mind simply upping the volume a notch or two, Apple airpods will do just fine.The contoured shape has another benefit: the airpods stay in very well while doing activites. I took them for a run with no issues, and played a little basketball and only had to readjust them a couple times.The battery life of Apple's airpods is as good as advertised, giving close to five hours of music playback in my test. Unless you're going for multiple marathons per day, they will more than suffice.The hallmark of airpods are their convenience. They automatically pair with your phone as soon as you open your case. The case, by the way, is as smooth and chic as it looks. The pods are touch controllable, meaning you can skip, rewind change volume, and control calls all with a tap. The call quality is great as well, almost better than an actual phone.In summary, for the fine-tuned product that Apple airpods are, the price is a bargain!"
4568,"April 21, 2020",5.0,I’m obsessed,  I LOVE these! Don’t get off brand it’s completely worth the money if you can afford it.

4592,"April 20, 2020",5.0,10/10 would recommend,  I love them. They work so good and are super handy. My favorite thing about them is that they automatically connect to your phone and the sound quality. The only problem is that you can loose them easily. But I recommend buying them.
4593,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Great gift!,  Just what we needed! They connect easy and sound is great.
4594,"April 20, 2020",3.0,AIRPODS ISSUE,"  HELLO, WE JUST GOT THE AIRPODS AND SUDDENLY THEY CANT CONNECT TO THE IPHONE ANYMORE, WE DID THE TROUBLESHOOTING ACCORDINGLY AND EVERYTHING RECOMMENDED AND NOTHING.THERE'S NO TYPE OF DAMAGE ON THEM (DIDNT DROP THEM OR NOTHING)CAN WE GET A REPLACEMENT OR WHAT CAN WE DO?"
4595,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Perfect,"  Authentic, and absolutely what I expected. Very happy with my order."
4596,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Pricey but worth it.,  Bought these for my daughter. She wanted the real airpods and I was skeptical because of the price but they are definitely worth it. They fit in her ears perfectly with no discomfort.
4597,"April 20, 2020",4.0,Good but..,  I live the AirPods but the thing is they are very easy to lose. Also when I am FaceTiming people when i talk it sounds weird and sometimes they cant hear me.

4599,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Great quality
4600,"April 20, 2020",1.0,FAKE !!!,"  I cannot stress this enough! THESE ARE FAKE!You can tell the authenticity of AirPods by looking at the back of the charging case. Is it silver and at the bottom, in small letters, states, “Designed by Apply in California. Assembled in China.” No? THEN IT’S FAKE!"
4601,"April 20, 2020",3.0,This is supposed to be new and it doesn’t work!!!!,"  The right side AirPod won’t work I reset it several times, and it still doesn’t work.I’m frustrated"

4608,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Great AirPods!!!,  Love them!!! Exactly as described!
4609,"April 20, 2020",1.0,Used and damaged AirPods,  I received used AirPods. There was earwax in the speakers and the left ear bud was crushed. It seems like someone swapped out there broken AirPods with a band new set. This is absolutely disgusting!!!
4610,"April 20, 2020",5.0,A great product.,  My son wanted these for work and more. A great surprise for Christmas.  He uses them all the time!
4611,"April 20, 2020",1.0,The right ear pod no longer works,"  I have had them since November 2019 and have worn them 3 times.  I have kept them charged and their has been no abuse to them.  The right one no longer works.  I want a replacement, but now Amazon does not answer the phone!"
4612,"April 20, 2020",4.0,The clicking noise is the only Issue,"  The product was good everything was Great until my AirPod case top start to click a little bit, like its loose or something? Idk if that is normal or not so I am confused. Besides that I loved them."
4613,"April 20, 2020",5.0,It’s a great product for telephone and music.,  I love this product in every way. I have suggested it to friends and family.
4614,"April 20, 2020",4.0,I’d bite the Apple again,"  They’re AirPods. Easy setup, easy to use, quick to charge and the case it’s sturdy. The best way to get the most out of the battery is to alternate use of each headphone one at a time, with the other charging."
4615,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Work Great with Apple Products,  Great sound quality and seamless integration with other Apple devices and products.
4616,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Great,  Great like everything recmind these and airpod pro both great
4617,"April 20, 2020",1.0,To big for my ears,  I really wanted these to work. To late to return but they have left sores in my ears. I think they are just to big for my ears. I have even bought silicone covers but still not able to use them.
4618,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Great quality,  Great product!
4619,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Good investment,  Arrived in 2 days and they are REAL  certified APPLE AirPods.
4620,"April 20, 2020",5.0,great product,"  great product, just what i asked for!"
4621,"April 20, 2020",4.0,Real Airpods,"  I received mine a few weeks ago, sound quality is fine and these are perfect for accessibility if you're looking for that kind of thing buy this. I will encourage you to call apple and confirm your applecare warranty, this device comes with 1 year, so you have clarity if this is real or fake. I bought 2 year warranty and called Apple, was told this is a 2nd generation device which is great and so my product is real. Also why shouldn't it be, this is being sold by Apple. Anyway, if you're concerned just call Apple and they will let you know. Also, I'm not impressed with the 5 hour battery on one full charge, mine seems to be a little less than that but those are the stats so gotta live with it. I know apple can do better than that.Anyways Happy shopping!"
4622,"April 20, 2020",1.0,Left earpiece stopped working within weeks.,  So disappointed. The left earpiece stopped working within just a few weeks. Bought as a gift and was not notified of the problem until return option expired. I can't stand Apple products! Too expensive to begin with and then you have to buy an extended warranty plan. How about they just WORK!!
4623,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Another Solid Apple Product,  I love these headphones. They connect seamlessly every time.  There is no delay and the left and right AirPod can be used independently.I am now working from home and these are a must for video calls and conference calls.
4624,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Great!,  Super light and fit well
4625,"April 20, 2020",5.0,It's an Apple Product you either love it or hate it,"  Work great easy to pair, battery life is great on the AirPods themselves as well as the recharging case."
4626,"April 20, 2020",1.0,Can I  get another one to replace the one i have.,  This product is not the best product to own one has cracked.

4630,"April 20, 2020",1.0,Bad sound quality and battery life,"  Bad sound quality. Every few mins, here disturbance... disconnects automatically...battery life is worst. Overall bad product"
4631,"April 20, 2020",5.0,It's an apple product nothing more to say!!,  Bought these for my husband and he loves them.Great sound!!
4632,"April 20, 2020",1.0,Need refund!,  I was told by a neighbor that he watched someone steal my package off my porch which was AirPods!!
4633,"April 20, 2020",5.0,Great present!,  Daughter using regularly.  AirPods work great.
4634,"April 19, 2020",1.0,Sent to me with ear wax! Unacceptable,  Sent to me with ear wax! Unacceptable

4637,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Authentic,  Battery life is great and charges really fast.
4638,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Horrible shipping,  Great product but shipping was horrible !
4639,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Apple won't help if u have a problem.,"  let me start with there are 5 people in my house. Which all have apple phone, I pads and air pods. I got my daughter air pods for Christmas 2019. Since the left ear bud stopped working and the case has metal fragments in it.  Cleary a defective case. I called customer support and was given 2 options. Take it to a apple store or best buy. All which are closed in PA due to Covid 19. Or pay a refundable deposit of 59.00 for the ear bud and 69.00 for the case. I don't feel like I should have to make that large of a deposit since they were 99.00 new. I asked for a manager. Who also said that is all I can offer you at this point. This burned mybutt,  since I have spent a lot of money on Apple products over the years. May I say I my self have switched to Samsung. At this point I'm tempted to switch my entire family too. You can be loyal like a dog. But you will be beat with the news paper for sure. They won't dare go out of there way to help you. I'm so over the BS with the customer service dept"
4640,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Excellent,"  new in the box, guaranteed apple quality"
4641,"April 19, 2020",1.0,buy from apple,  its not worth it to buy it from amazom  and 20 dollers less buy from apple beacuse you never know if its from apple you dont knpw who is the seller so not good and they have no costimer servise they dont care and they are not nice to you had bad sound bad conection to my iphone not judt any phone and it was bad
4642,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Excellent battery life,  They’re great. They have excellent battery life and are supper comfortable.
4643,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Perfect set of headphones,"  Works great.  You can't bend your head down while talking to someone though. If you do, it makes the headphones think you have taken the right one out of your ear which makes them turn off."
4644,"April 19, 2020",1.0,So disappointed,  They don't good I've been using it for one week and now they don't paired to my fone anymore I would love to returned them so disappointed
4645,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Don’t hesitate to purchase these!,  If Apple only made hearing aids!  My goodness the clarity of sound is superb.
4646,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Legit & Good,"  This is a legit Apple Product. If you had a bad experience, it was probably that someone ordered it and returned fake airpods. Mine were good and new."
4647,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Great as expected!,  Sound great! Comfortable!
4648,"April 19, 2020",5.0,The best !!!,  Love it
4649,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Great quality air pods !,"  The air pods are really easy to connect. The sound is great; considering that I just got them this morning, I'm not sure of how long the battery life is."
4650,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Daughter Loves these so much.,  Bought these for my daughter on her Birthday. She loves them and is blown away by the battery life. They paired so easy with her phone.
4651,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Does Apple sell anything that isn’t perfect?,  Bought these for my daughter for her birthday. I also have a pair. I hate putting things in my ear but this doesn’t disappoint.
4652,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Amazing purchase,  Amazing sound quality and AirPods came in perfect condition. I never knew how much I needed these until I bought them! 100% recommend.
4653,"April 19, 2020",5.0,I really recommend this item,  I LOVE ITTTT so much!!!
4654,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  Very useful for work.
4655,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Cannot turn up the volume,  Cannot turn up the volume
4656,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Airpods,  A gift and my kid loves them!
4657,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Very happy with our airpods
4658,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Great earbuds.,"  As much as I am not a fan of apple products, they knocked it out of the park with these. 0 complaints, just great. And i say that begrudgingly..."
4659,"April 19, 2020",5.0,Apple Airpods,  I love Apple Products.  They just work. I have the Airpods Pro and purchased these for my wife.  Love them!
4660,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Worth the price,"  A little late to the party, but I’m glad I joined. Sound quality is amazing. I was skeptical because of the price, but it’s so worth it. Easy to connect, comfortable, and they charge super fast."
4661,"April 18, 2020",1.0,Bad connection,"  They beep every minute when I'm watching videos, and lose connection for about 20 min. I've already replaced one pair. Guess they might be defective or refurbished ones."
4662,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Love it!
4663,"April 18, 2020",1.0,That they don’t work right now,"  My AirPods ain’t working right now i don’t know what happened to them, they worked goo first day but the second day they stop working"
4664,"April 18, 2020",5.0,work well,"  All good, fast deliver, will buy from again, great price"
4665,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Airpods!,  These overprice little ear phones are great! The sound quality is good and I'm still using them even though they've come out with a newer model. The charging case is great because I can charge on the go!
4666,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Love them!
4667,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Good product.,"  Its comfortable, its a one size fits all. Good sound quality, no noise cancellation like Airpod Pro but the airpod itself blocks some noise. EX: Much quieter while mowing the lawn. The left airpod has less battery life than the right for some reason, but no noticeable difference."
4668,"April 18, 2020",5.0,I brought these for my girlfriend!~,  She loves them. And before you go reading that people asking if its fake or not. It's not fake. It's literally apple selling on amazon. Always buy them from APPLE's page and not 3rd party sellers cause then you'll be screwed if they do end up selling you a fake. Funny enough when I got Airpods Pro from the Apple Store they were beaten up. When I got them on Amazon brand freaking new. Also if you ever want to check if they are real. Just go on the apple website check the code thats on the airpods and check if they've been registered.
4669,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Must Have,  I love my airpods.
4670,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Reemplazo,  Por equivocación me enviaron otro producto
4671,"April 18, 2020",5.0,😍😍,  nice
4672,"April 18, 2020",4.0,Pairing good but Too Many Flaw,  Pros: simple and always fast to connect.Cons: slip out of ear especially during exercise. Had to wrap on tape to get them to stay and still a problem.Sound quality for talking not as good as wired Apple earbuds. And they pick up too much background noise if you are doing anything. Annoying to listener on other end.
4673,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Excellent,"  Intuitive, great connectivity across multiple devices"
4674,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Love,  I love my new AirPods!
4675,"April 18, 2020",5.0,A great gift idea,  I bought these as a gift. The recipient loves them.
4676,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Worth the money!,  Better than expected
4677,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Can't go wrong with original apple products.,"  Got a perfect pair, battery lasts over 3 hours of continuous listening time, seamless transition from iphone to ipad to iwatch using your apple id was the most important feature for me since i switch from device to device very often... only paired with my phone and that was it."
4678,"April 18, 2020",4.0,They are what they are...,"  Works Great, good design, and easy to set up. Not better than some less expensive options, so a bit over priced."
4679,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Very expensive but it’s worth it,"  Perfect, impressed by the quality of the sound. Still very expensive for earphones but it’s worth it"
4680,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Comfortable!,"  I tried two other set of air pods but one was too big for my ears and the other one didn't work well.  I love these!  They fit my ears well, have great sound quality and the battery life seems to be pretty decent.  I have not figured out how to answer a call yet by tapping on the ear bud but hopefully will figure it out soon.  I definitely recommend getting the Apple brand and not an off-brand.  They are worth the money."
4681,"April 18, 2020",4.0,Sounds better than the Galaxy buds. Period.,"  Sounds better than my buds side by side on note, iPhone X, iPads pro 2rd gen. The bass on the airpods is clear and solid. The overall sound dynamics are far more weighty and coherent, listening to both Wagner's grand March and talking videos. The Samsung wearable app is useless as far as the sound quality goes.The magnetic mechanism of the airpods charger keeps the pods securely connected. The Galaxy buds weren't charged at all for me once when they weren't sat properly somehow. If not handled carefully, the little buds can easily fall out of the charger and lost.Airpods have two legs make them easier to handle and they do NOT make the pods fall off. In fact I am pleasantly surprised that the pods are very secure in the ears without the rubbery pieces like the Galaxy buds do. You need to put the buds on the right way to secure them in the ears. Airpods just securely sit in the ears, no wiggling needed. Several times the playback were interrupted when I try to wiggle the Galaxy buds in my ears.Not so great: airpods need to hold the button on the charger to connect to a new device the first time, a rather ancient way of doing business. Worse, no visual audio feedback when holding the button on the pods or the charger. Apple should have gone all the way like all the other Bluetooth devices, flash red or blue lights while at it.  Samsung buds has no need for that. But on the other hand, Galaxy buds need the app for Android. Should have been optional .The last one is IMHO for sure: I like the Samsung charger better, only if it has the same magnetic mechanisms. It just looks cooler and more solid. The airpods charger looks like a floss box. The shiny white plastic is slippery and the little lid feels flimsy comparing to the Galaxy charger, which has a very solid and reassuring click when open or close. Were the man still around, this probably would have done better.But the sound is the winner for me. I'm am exchange the buds for the pods, today!"
4682,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Love em,"  Very happy with these. Rarely charge, last long. Good quality. Connect to laptop as well"
4683,"April 18, 2020",1.0,Empty box,  Got delivered with nothing in the box but the charger cord. So disappointing!!
4684,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Up to par,  Never any issues with apple
4685,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Great airpods 👍👍,"  I love these so much, they work perfectly & are so loud 👍👍"
4686,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Amazing difference between sound as well as ease to use. Well worth the money
4687,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Great wireless ear phones,"  This is my second pair because I loved them so much, I wanted to have one pair in the car and one pair in the house.  I had left them in the house and when I got to work I was sad.  So, I had to buy a second pair.  I LOVE THEM!"
4688,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Charge with 1amp only,  I like that durable in dusty invirement
4689,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Love them,  Golf quality! Arrived faster than anticipated :)
4690,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Worth the hype,  I typically hate ear buds. I hate things in my ears. But these are light and just lay gently in your ear. They’re great for making the phone hands free or enhancing confidentiality on a conference call.
4691,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Get them,  Love my AirPods. These came quickly and work amazingly. I love using them for working out; they don't fall out and the lack of wire is great.
4692,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Awesome!,  Like this product a lot and came on time!
4693,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Best thing I ever bought,"  Bets purchase I have made. You can also verify them on Apple to confirm they are authentic, and they are."
4694,"April 18, 2020",5.0,love these,  complete life changer tbh. Cant go without them. Third pair for a third family member.
4695,"April 18, 2020",5.0,Nice,  I have never liked ear buds till now! These baby’s are nice and they don’t make your ears sore!

4701,"April 17, 2020",5.0,Inside box,  Came with charger in back of box also and great sound quality .... noise cancellation is amazing .
4702,"April 17, 2020",5.0,Favorite Purchase of the Year,"  I purchased these as a gift for my wife.  At first, she wasn't sure if she would use them but they quickly became her favorite accessory.  She uses them when watching TV on her phone and needs to walk away for a moment with no need to carry her phone with her; she hooks them up to our Apple TV and can freely move around without having to lug anything else around.  She connects to her work laptop and uses them when grading her students' multimedia projects.  They fit her well (I have a pair as well and they are quite comfortable), they have outstanding battery life (she's not one to remember to charge accessories, but these last weeks without a need for a charge), and they just work.  Who has time to fiddle with bluetooth connections and such?  Highly recommended."
4703,"April 17, 2020",5.0,love these,  they are really good!

4707,"April 17, 2020",5.0,AirPods for the Ears,"  Since school has went to online, my college student needed to be able to have something that he could use, cord-free, for choir. The Airpods work for this, has a microphone, and is not too bassy, which is the problem with other headphones that we had tried."

4720,"April 17, 2020",5.0,Must buenoooo,  Vwey good
4721,"April 17, 2020",4.0,Many great features,"  I love these earbuds and never leave home without them! The wireless connectivity is great and the range is much larger than I initially thought. 4 stars for battery because I can tell that the battery is getting worse now that I have had them for a few months. I am very hard on my headphones but they still do hold up and there is no cord to get tangled! The sound quality is great as well as noise cancellation, though they do not hold up when compared to my Bose on ear wireless headphones, which is to be expected. I have struggled to get the controls to work (like tapping to pause) but I suspect that is user error. The mic is decent, though it could be better. It is super helpful to have these headphones connected to my Apple Watch and iPhone. I highly recommend them for daily use."

4732,"April 17, 2020",5.0,Great product,  Got the AirPods on sale. Great deal and couldn’t be happier. It arrived very quickly and was well packaged.
4733,"April 17, 2020",5.0,Worth the cost,  Tried getting generic ones for a few months then finally get these. Wow such a difference. The sound is great they work amazing
4734,"April 16, 2020",4.0,Battery life only 3 hours,"  I don’t like that they only last for three hours, but they do charge up fast pretty quickly. Other than that, great buy."
4735,"April 16, 2020",4.0,Needs a better locator,"  These are of great quality, but the location device is flawed. You can only locate them if they are not in the case. If you misplace them and they are inside he charging case, too bad. Bye bye $150."
4736,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Very pleased,  Awesome! I was really excited to treat myself with AirPods. Exactly as expected and SUPER fast shipping!
4737,"April 16, 2020",1.0,No AIRPODS in box,"  My box came with NO AIRPODS. Just a clearly previously opened box (no plastic covering), eevn though I bought them brand new. I have no idea what to do. How do I report this??"
4738,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Very easy to connect whit any device!,  Very reliable product
4739,"April 16, 2020",1.0,Only one air pod worked,  When I took it out of the package only the right air pod would turn on. Returning them
4740,"April 16, 2020",2.0,Simply didn’t stay in my ear,"  Simply doesn’t stay in my ear.  I tried some of the suggested tips, but nothing seemed to work.  Other than that, they’re awesome!!"
4741,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Great buy,  Sounds perfect. They are original Apple AirPods in the original box wrapped up in plastic. Been already using it for about 2 hours and battery life is at same percentage. Came with a charger. Easy to pair once I took my iPhone out it automatically asked to pair.
4742,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Very happy,  Love it
4743,"April 16, 2020",1.0,after a few months of using them left one stopped working,"  Used the Air pods for a few months, worked great, until the left one stopped working for no reason, no damage was done to them, one day it just stoped working, and apple charges to fix or replace."
4744,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Nice,  Great item
4745,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Don’t delay!,  I was super against hopping on the AirPod bandwagon for a while I will admit. But these were on sale and I was on an online shopping spree and said why not. And I am so so so glad I bought them and so sad I waited so long to buy them. Great audio and noise cancelling. They stay in amazingly. I’ve worked out and had a bedroom dance party to test them and they stay in and sound is great the whole time.
4746,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Honestly A Game Changer,  I put off ordering these as I just refused to believe they would be better than what I was using. They are a game changer! I work from home and have to field calls all day long.  I can easily move around without having the sound drop or flinging my phone somewhere because there is a wire connecting me to them. I am so glad that I bought them.  They pair easily to Apple devices and the sound quality is good.
4747,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Awesome,  My wife loved everything about it thank you so much and be safe.
4748,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Good buy,  I bought for my son as a Christmas present. It seems he has had them in his ear since Christmas. The charge last a nice length of time. He is happy so I am too.
4749,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Awesome AirPods,"  My son loves them, very worth the money."
4750,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Don't buy the knockoffs,"  We made the mistake of buying the knockoffs, and you definitely see a difference in sound quality, noise cancellations, and battery life.  You also do not get the seamless connection with your phone that you do with the Apple AirPods.  We bought a silicone sleeve to cover the case so it doesn't scratch.  Overall, we are highly satisfied with the purchase."
4751,"April 16, 2020",4.0,Good sound!,  Fit nicely in ears
4752,"April 16, 2020",4.0,they’re so great but.. are overated,"  these are awesome! I got mine today and they’re great, they work well but there’s always a but, the case seems make a clicky noise at the hinge, and if i push it side to side it clicks too, i recommend but it is better if you can buy the wireless case for this one"
4753,"April 16, 2020",5.0,best for workout,  i love them as it has pretty decent bass. Airpods stays in my ear even while going out for a run.
4754,"April 16, 2020",2.0,Not good quality.,"  We purchased 2 of these and have had issues with them both. They don’t always connect, they cut out, there’s poor sound quality, the list goes on. We were really disappointed because these weren’t cheap."
4755,"April 16, 2020",3.0,Some of the functions are erratic,  Bluetooth keeps disconnecting. I have to reconnect each time to my laptop. The double-tap pause and play function is erratic.
4756,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Love it,  Works wonderfully no issues so far
4757,"April 16, 2020",3.0,Lasts about 6 months,"  I bought these in october, and now it’s april and both airpods are not working correctly. To hear sound at all, you can’t put it in your ear all the way. You have to angle it just right to hear anything. But I mean it worked great for 5-6 months!!"
4758,"April 16, 2020",5.0,These are some great air pods they don’t slip out of your ears,  Not applicable
4759,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Madys review,  This was great! It was just like the AirPods in the Apple store and was much cheaper. I recommend saving a little money and not getting the wireless charging because it’s not worth it. Other than that everything has been good.
4760,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Great!,  they work great!
4761,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Great!,  My daughter loves them!
4762,"April 16, 2020",5.0,👍🏻,  I love these so much I use them all the time and can’t remember life without them😂 they are really pricey but thank me later you will not regret buying these!
4763,"April 16, 2020",5.0,I didn’t know I needed this in my life,"  I’ve had these for over two months now and I absolutely love them. I was hesitant on getting them at first because of the price, but I use them literally everywhere. Easy to sleep with them in your ears and great for video calls! I don’t regret making this purchase and I’m glad I did because I can now move freely without wires getting in the way. Also, if you have an iPhone 8 or above, you don’t have to worry about charging your phone and listening to music at the same time!"
4764,"April 16, 2020",1.0,Fake EarPods,  They’re fine quality but fake found this out when I lost one and order a new one replacement EarPods from apple please don’t buy waste of money
4765,"April 16, 2020",1.0,Miserable experience,  My airpods worked for a couple of months after which the left airpod stopped connecting. I booked an appointment with apple store. Of course when I went to the store the left airpod was working. Since then it has not been working.
4766,"April 16, 2020",3.0,Not impressed,"  I love Apple, but these airpods slide out of your ear unless you have non slip covers. Additionally, for as pricey as they are, they quit working a month later. They sometimes pair and sometimes don't. I was shocked given Apple has a high quality product generally speaking. I bought Boltune wireless buds and they work just the same and stay in - very sturdy - for 1/3 the price!"
4767,"April 16, 2020",5.0,Apple need you say more?,"  A brand that is synonymous with quality. Used between Iphone, iPad and iPod without a problem. These are nit noise canceling but ambient noise is adequately shielded by design. Very comfortable and microphone makes talking hands free on the phone convenient. Charging is fast too."
4768,"April 16, 2020",1.0,Only had these for 4 months and the are not working,"  I ordered these as a Christmas Gift, they have been in use since January 2020 it is April 2020 and they are no longer working. The phone has been updated, the air pods have been reset and nothing. This is disappointing."
4769,"April 16, 2020",2.0,Not new was used,  This product wasnt new it had a name on the Bluetooth AlreadyI’m disappointed
4770,"April 15, 2020",4.0,Yay- update Nay!!!,"  I LOVE THEMUpdate. A few days later they would not connect to my phone at all. Also, one airpod would die wayyy faster than the other one. I got a replacment though."
4771,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Legit,  Great buy and super easy to use
4772,"April 15, 2020",1.0,Ugh! Charger case lost,  Charger lost
4773,"April 15, 2020",2.0,Broken in less than 1 year,  Less than 1 year and these things aren’t working.  Trying to use Apple’s 1 year warranty to get them repaired.
4774,"April 15, 2020",5.0,It is a amazing product would recommend,  I recommend this product to others because they make it easy to listen to music because you just pop them in your ear and do not make your ear sore or make your ear hurt.What sets it apart from other products is that it is very simple and there has not been a product made like it before on the market today .In my opinion the best thing about this product is it is very easy to use for anything.A down fall that a future consumer might have is that they discharge after a while but if you don’t mind that then you should definitely go and get AirPods.
4775,"April 15, 2020",3.0,convenient,  The AirPods are truly convenient. But the sound and battery are just ok.
4776,"April 15, 2020",2.0,Don’t stay in place but the sound quality is good,"  These aren’t the most comfortable because I feel like I really have to jam these in my ears & twist them so They stay in place. If doing any moderately rigorous jog or higher, these continually need to be readjusted. I do love that the case charges & the battery life on both the case & the buds is good! They are noise canceling enough for my needs & were so so user friendly to set upUpdate—3 months in, the sound sucks...it’s very low & ive followed various bits of input to clean, turn off/on Bluetooth etc & nothing worked. After less than 3 mo, that’s not acceptable"
4777,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Very satisfied,  Very satisfied with these AirPods from Apple.
4778,"April 15, 2020",1.0,🤦🏼‍♀️,  Bought these in January and they already quit working!!! Too much money for them to go out that quick!!!
4779,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Just as described!,  Perfect!
4780,"April 15, 2020",2.0,Disappointed,"  My niece has had hers for a while and loved them. So I thought I would give them a try.The first issue I have with them is the battery does not last longer than 3 hours. (That might be my bad, maybe they are not designed to.) If I am going to be on a call longer than 3 hours, I do like that i can use one earbud and the other can stay charging in the case. I do lose any noise canceling that it does that way. In addition sometimes the one earbud will not have audio. I have to put in and take it out of the case a few times to get it to work, so as long as I try switching the earbud before the one dies I can talk longer than 3 hours.The next issue I have is they do not always connect to my iPhone 11 and/or my Samsung Note 10+. I actually have better luck with the Samsung than the iPhone. Once I get the Samsung to connect it will almost always do so, the audio might cut in and out but they connect. The iPhone on the other hand will say it is connected but there will be no audio. It is frustrating, maybe it is the two phones that cause the issues, I am not sure. I bought them because so many loved them, but I would not recommend them at unless you really do not talk long on your phone and only  had one phone. Then maybe you would have less issues than I have had."
4781,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Absolutely great!,"  I’m 64 and have a high frequency hearing loss. These sound great, even to me! Crisp, clear with solid bass. Pairing is automatic. Couldn’t be simpler. (I have an iPhone 7 Plus) Very comfortable to wear. I have not had them long enough to judge battery life, but I’m sure they will do well."
4782,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Excellent 👌🏽,  Excellent 👌🏽
4783,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Amazing,  These are amazing i bought a silicone case for them too. all of it came 4 days early than expected. the case is so fun to click
4784,"April 15, 2020",1.0,Mine showed up with earwax in them!!!!!,  I’m so disappointed mine showed up today and the packaging was dirty and the AirPods them selfs had SOMEONES EARWAX in them!!!!!!! I thought I was buying brand new AirPods. Even if they were used ew!
4785,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Excelente,  Excelente
4786,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Perfect gift.,  Bought for my daughter for Christmas. She loves them.

4790,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Love it!!,  Loved them!! Use them everyday!!
4791,"April 15, 2020",5.0,You should buy them!,"  I was worried getting these off amazon just because it wasn’t from apple, but they are the exact same and work great! I love them."
4792,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Love them buttttt,  The only thing I didn’t like is they kinda go dead fast. But other than that they are just perfect !
4793,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Great item!,"  I’ve been on the fence about AirPods for a while, and when I️ saw that amazon had them cheaper than Apple, I️ wanted to try them out. I️ ended up quickly buying a second pair for my husband because they were so great! Delivered on time!"
4794,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Perfec,  Literally connects perfectly and goes based off the name of your phone.
4795,"April 15, 2020",1.0,ineligible to an Apple care +,"  Confirmed fake - I compared to the ones I just received from Apple.Apple considers the one I got as ineligible to an Apple care +Which is a shame since I experienced the batteries die after 2 years.Still AirPods are a great product, so I ended up ordering on apple.com"
4796,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Great earbuds,  Bought these for my daughter for Christmas in 2019 she loves them she listens to music non stop and  these work great for her as she can wear them to work and out with her friends. These are much better than any of  the other brands and they are easy to hook to your phone and use
4797,"April 15, 2020",5.0,Five stars fo sho!,"  I’ve been jammin all day, I really like them, they some 5 star hoes fo sho!"
