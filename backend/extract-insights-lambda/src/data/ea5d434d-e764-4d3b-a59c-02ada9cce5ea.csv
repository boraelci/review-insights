0,"May 7, 2023",5.0,AMazing product,Wow the new version of this is awesome
1,"May 7, 2023",5.0,Wonderful product,Bought for husbands bday present and they are amazing they wirk just fine with android phones too
2,"May 7, 2023",5.0,Sound cancellation,Great product. Noise cancellation is amazing. Music quality is fantastic.
3,"May 6, 2023",5.0,Eh,"Very good AirPods. Wouldn‚Äôt change them for the world. Only bad thing is tho, if you loose one or flush it down the toilet üöΩ while doing your business, then you won‚Äôt be able to use just one AirPod, you have to have the other one as well, just ask me how I know LMAO ü§£"
4,"May 6, 2023",5.0,Great sound,I have the first gen air pods and they were ok at best. The AirPods Pro are much better and the noise cancellation on these are amazing like being in a concert hall love them.
5,"May 6, 2023",5.0,Coming from AirPods Pro 1st Gen,"Let me make this short and sweet. I‚Äôve owned the 1st gen since launch. Right side went bad. I went to Apple and they told me a replacement for one side would be $90. They also mentioned the other side could fail. They recommended me to get a new pair and the upgrade would be worth it instead of paying for replacements out of warranty.Thanked them and left the Apple Store, said I would think about it. Checked Amazon and they were on sale for $199. Bought the AppleCare too.They ARE better. The noise cancellation is definitely better and the sound profile is better. You get 4 sizes of ear tips now instead of 3. Charging case is better as well with a speaker for finding them. No regrets at all."
6,"May 6, 2023",2.0,Still connected to the previous owner‚Äôs iCloud,"Came in great shape, and got them to connect. But the previous owner never forgot the device, so I can‚Äôt use them as mine now. Why sell an Apple product that is still connected to someone else‚Äôs iCloud? This sucks, because these were supposed to replace my missing ones."
7,"May 6, 2023",5.0,Amazing!,The second GEN ear buds are much better. Especially the noise canceling
8,"May 6, 2023",5.0,Very nice,Worked fantastic right out of the box. Paired right up to my iPhone and all the features are amazing. The noise cancellation works incredible.
9,"May 6, 2023",5.0,Muy buenos pero‚Ä¶,"La calidad del sonido la contextura del producto es muy bueno. Lo malo es que se caen, prob√© con diferentes almohadillas y siempre se me cayeron los auriculares."
10,"May 6, 2023",2.0,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,üçé Apple aught to be ashamed of themselves for putting crap on the market like this!The headphones fall out of my ear if I laugh or even smile while talking on the phoneand I have tried all of the suctions that come with the podsMy friend constantly tells me she cannot hear me when my volume is at its highestThe charge does not last longI find myself making sure to charge them every nightDO NOT PURCHASE! Expensive and not worth the price
11,"May 5, 2023",2.0,Tried on all the sizes they just won‚Äôt stay in my ear.,The best sound and noise canceling I‚Äôve ever experienced in an earbud but constantly falls out of my ear. I tried every size earpiece that it came with they all slowly dislodge and then fall out.I‚Äôm sure Apple spent 100‚Äôs of millions developing these just to get the basics wrong. Will stick with my Power Beats Pro as they never fall out!
12,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Sounds is perfect,I work around LOUD heavy machinery and it cancels noise great! Also very loud.
13,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Love it,Great product I use it every day
14,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Apple of course!!!,"I like the sound quality, battery life is fair! Charge is fast!!!"
15,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Of course these are great,Apple products are wonderful
16,"May 5, 2023",5.0,As described,I got these for a relative in Australia who had heard they were great and coveted a pair. He loves the fit and sound cancelling capability.
17,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Very good.,The AirPods Pro 2 are really good. Noise canceling makes any car an electric car.
18,"May 5, 2023",1.0,These are definitely fake!,"I bought these a few months ago, I am not sure if they were returned or not. They are both uncomfortable, hard to work, and the sound quality is awful. People tell me that it sounds like pig are with me when I am using them to talk on the phone. Please help me to return them for a real version!"
19,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Must buy,Love them!
20,"May 5, 2023",1.0,Static/ Audio Issues in 2 weeks,Ordered these as a gift for my wife 4 weeks ago. Gave them to her as a birthday gift days later then after about 2 weeks she began to complain about static in the left earpiece. I reached out for a replacement and although it‚Äôs less than 30 days they say the window is closed. This new Amazon policy SUCKS!
21,"May 5, 2023",5.0,Fantastic,"Whether you like Apple or not, these are some of the best quality earbuds you can get. Sounds quality, as well as quality of the noise cancelling is superior to most other buds I‚Äôve had. Would 100% recommend"
22,"May 4, 2023",5.0,The Best!,"Me han encantado, aunque creo que esperaba mucho m√°s de la cancelaci√≥n de ruido, no s√© si eso mejore con un cambio de almohadillas o que yo viva en un lugar muy ruidoso, hay mucho hipe en internet, pero por sobre todas las cosas no los dejar√≠a de recomendar, al escuchar m√∫sica cumple al 100% su funci√≥n y la calidad es increible"
23,"May 4, 2023",5.0,My first AirPods!!,"I‚Äôm so excited ,my first AirPods! They can announce when anyone calls if you‚Äôre listen to music, they have different ear fittings for a comfortable fit. You don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre in your ear. Love!! Love!!"
24,"May 4, 2023",3.0,Finicky charging?,"I seem to be the only one experiencing this based on reviews but I have issues with my AirPods charging. I don‚Äôt even use them that much, they aren‚Äôt dirty, but I often go to put them in and find one or both of the ear buds totally dead. They aren‚Äôt sitting in the case correctly I‚Äôm guessing? Very frustrating. Otherwise I like how they fit and the noise canceling is decent, just wish they were more reliable."
25,"May 4, 2023",3.0,Do not buy if you are not nearby an apple store,"If you don't use iphone or ipad, and your airpod has issue. Good luck, it is a hassle."
26,"May 4, 2023",1.0,Nasty disgusting,As you can see in the pictures i was disgusting and disappointed when i opened my package.
27,"May 4, 2023",5.0,They are awesome headphones,"I had Apple AirPods when they were first released a few years ago. Those were my favorite headphones. These new AirPods Pros are really great to use. I am able to listen to music, take calls, and travel with them. Also, they work well between iPhone and Mac, they are easy to switch devices. They are seamless to use and feel almost like magic. Thanks for releasing these Apple and great work to all the engineers and scientists"
28,"May 4, 2023",2.0,Falling apart,"Don't buy, not even a year later they are falling apart. Also the feature of location find is not working anymore."
29,"May 4, 2023",5.0,Another best buy,"I had to replace my last set and debated on spending the money but I am glad I did. I do not leave home without them. Great for laying by the pool and also, ignoring the neighbors."
30,"May 4, 2023",1.0,Don't buy these,"I HATE these AirPods. Connecting them to my iPhone is a nightmare. they never connect the first time. If you take one off for a moment and then put it back on the pair refuse to play together until I take them both out and put them back on together. No one can hear me talk on the phone when I use them for phone calls. Everyone says I sound muffled or like I am underwater. on top of these issues they fallout constantly. it is extremely stupid and irritating. I have tried troubleshooting, switching the ear cushions etc. nothing is working. I had the 2nd generation AirPods (not pro) and they were great. the sound was great, I never had issues with them falling out or people not being able to hear me talk on the phone. There's a reason they still sell those. These are not worth the cost. I am going to sell them and buy Sony earbuds."
31,"May 4, 2023",1.0,Keep cutting out,These cut out and glitch constantly until I disconnect and reconnect Bluetooth. I think I may have received and refurbished pair or something.
32,"May 4, 2023",5.0,An upgrade from first generation.,More features and much better noise cancellation system. Well worth the upgrade. Also got a good deal which made it even better.
33,"May 4, 2023",4.0,Awesome AirPods Pro!,"Four stars! I received these AirPods Pro as a Christmas gift last year and immediately loved them! I appreciate these AirPods for their design, functionality and features.To begin, the new generation of AirPods Pro has a sleek design with shorter arms. The shorter arms make the AirPods look more modern and prevents from getting caught on your shirt/sweater when changing. The earbuds also now include silicone ear tips for more comfort. The purchase comes with 4 extra replaceable ear tips that offer different sizes or your unique ear shape as well. This is helpful to find your specific size. I havent experienced any trouble with the earbuds staying put in my ears. The case is slightly larger than previous generations, which makes it easier to find when digging in your bag to grab them, however still compact enough to easily fit into pockets. On the case, you‚Äôll find a speaker that plays sounds to locate in case lost and alerts you when the battery is running low, a charging port and lanyard loop.Second, the AirPods Pro score highly when it comes to functionality. The sound quality is great and highly improved in comparison to previous models. It has clear, crisp sound and rich bass which makes the experience much more enjoyable. I feel like I‚Äôm in the studio! This new generation offers Active Noise Cancellation. This greatly helps block out any surrounding noise that distracts whatever you‚Äôre listening to. On the other hand, the AirPods Pro also offer Transparency mode. This mode makes it useful to easily hear your surroundings while your audio remains playing. It has an echo effect that slightly tunes out the music while mainly focusing on voices directly in front of you. Basically, this is the opposite of the ANC feature I previously mentioned.Lastly, similar to the older AirPods, the case includes a built-in lightning charger as well as a charging port. It has a 6 hour battery life from a single charge! A 4 ft cord is also provided in the box. The new U1 chip enables the Find My feature with precise finding for the case.Aside from the pricetag, I am very impressed with the new, extra features that the AirPods Pro offers!"
34,"May 4, 2023",5.0,Perfect gift!,Got these as a birthday gift for my brother in law! He was so happy!
35,"May 4, 2023",5.0,Top quality,"Top quality sound, easy and quick connection"
36,"May 3, 2023",1.0,Not worth the money,Worked great for a few days‚Ä¶ been on my bedside table for about a month‚Ä¶ picked them up to use them last night and they were staticky‚Ä¶ disconnected and reconnected and still same issue‚Ä¶ what a waste..
37,"May 3, 2023",5.0,Love it!,Love my Apple Airpods Pros !!!!!
38,"May 3, 2023",5.0,I like them,I like the noise cancelling feature the most.
39,"May 3, 2023",5.0,Amazing!,Had the last gen and upgraded after loosing them. New ones blew me away! Fidelity beyond anything I‚Äôve heard in an earbud style. Battery goes forever!
40,"May 3, 2023",2.0,Full of known issues ranging from software to hardware,"I received these as a gift on Christmas back in 2020. I would say it‚Äôs been a good few years that these have worked, but that would be a false statement. From the beginning there were multiple instances of connection issues to my iPhone. The headphones have a known issue of making rattling, buzzing and vibration sounds, with or without noise cancellation on. This was pointed out to me by Apple customer service. I had to send these in twice when they were under warranty to have each earbud replaced for this reason, which only increased the connectivity issues even after going through the pairing and resetting guide with and without help from customer service. Despite this, the new earbuds I received had the EXACT same issues that I had to send them in for originally, and they were out of warranty. I refused to spend 1/3 of the cost of a brand new set on repair service, so I‚Äôve been dealing with the strange buzzing sounds ever since (about 1.5 years of buzzing). Despite frequent software updates, my right headphone no longer responded to ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù commands, completely ignoring them. Ever since I received the first new pair, I‚Äôve had friends complain how they can‚Äôt hear me well when I use them for phone calls. Finally, the very last straw from this product was when the case would not charge my AirPods. I fully charged the case for multiple hours, and the battery of the case would flicker from 100% while charging to 0% immediately after I removed the charger from the case. Now the case only charges the AirPods while the case is on the charger. I looked it up and it is a battery fail issue, which would cost me money to have replaced. Probably over $100 repair. I decided I would rather spend my money on a $40 pair of bluetooth noise cancelling headphones that would likely do a better job at the mangled mess of failed operations that my AirPods did in the last 2 years of use.The noise cancellation is okay, I have a pair of Bose headphones that do a better job that I would use instead if that‚Äôs what I was looking for. ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù commands are nice if they work (like only my left headphone would). Sound quality is good but nothing special. Would I recommend these? No. Get yourself a better functioning pair, you‚Äôre only paying for name brand here."
41,"May 3, 2023",1.0,Item stopped working,Both left and right ear will not work and even though product is under warranty Apple will not repair it. This might have been refurbished or water damaged from seller and now I‚Äôm stuck with this crap. Don‚Äôt buy it!
42,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Can‚Äôt beat an apple product!,I was concerned about the fit but with three sizes included I found a great fit!
43,"May 2, 2023",1.0,Deficient product,The product was deficient and it was not able to be properly charged
44,"May 2, 2023",5.0,very comfortable,"I am delighted to provide a glowing review for the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) Wireless Earbuds. These earbuds are an incredible piece of technology that provides an amazing audio experience like no other.The standout feature of the AirPods Pro is the active noise cancelling technology. With up to 2x more active noise cancelling than the previous generation, these earbuds provide an incredibly immersive audio experience. I was amazed at how effectively they blocked out background noise, making it easy to fully concentrate on my music or podcasts.But what really sets these earbuds apart is the adaptive transparency feature. This feature allows me to hear important external sounds, like traffic or a person speaking to me, while still enjoying my audio content. It's an incredibly useful feature that ensures I stay safe and aware of my surroundings while still enjoying my audio.The sound quality of the AirPods Pro is top-notch as well. The bass is deep and rich, while the mid-range and treble are crisp and clear. Whether I'm listening to music or podcasts, the audio is always balanced and enjoyable.The earbuds themselves are also comfortable and easy to wear. The silicone tips fit securely in my ears and the earbuds stay in place even during vigorous exercise. And with the wireless charging case, I never have to worry about running out of battery.Overall, I highly recommend the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) Wireless Earbuds. They are an incredible piece of technology that provide an immersive audio experience and a comfortable fit. If you're in the market for high-quality earbuds, the AirPods Pro are definitely worth considering."
45,"May 2, 2023",5.0,great sound,They stay in your ears even when active.
46,"May 2, 2023",3.0,Crackling sound!,"When these airpods work, they work well, until the crackling static noise starts, at least with mine. I've tried every single suggestion from apple, from recent updates, removing the device, but nothing resolves this issue. It's so frustrating I don't use them much at all. It's a shame because they're not cheap. If someone has advice I would appreciate it."
47,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Excellent,Excellent ... Superb quality
48,"May 2, 2023",2.0,Buying These AirPods Was A Mistake,"These AirPods don‚Äôt work as advertised‚Ä¶!!!! So disappointed at the money I wasted. And, once you open the package, they are non-returnable, unless actually defective. I should have bought a different brand."
49,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Great noise canceling,Gift for my adult son. He asked for an update on AirPods. He really liked the better noise canceling function and said the quality is definitely noticeable.
50,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Significant update to the original.,Noise cancellation.
51,"May 2, 2023",5.0,These really are amazing,"My son wanted these for his birthday more than anything. He has AirPods gen 2, but wanted this newer upgraded version. He says the noise cancellation is phenomenal and the sound quality is amazing. Totally worth the price, and made a wonderful birthday gift."
52,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Very Goods,"Excellent sound, ideal, the only negative is the battery"
53,"May 2, 2023",5.0,"I was hesitant, but‚Ä¶..","I currently own the GEN twos the GEN threes and the AirPod Pro second generation for months now ..what I learned is this all of them sound excellent and work perfectly with an iPhone you are paying for the different features each one offers that being said I was hesitant to buy AirPod pros because of the price and because I don‚Äôt care for silicon tips but after using them if you can afford them, the noise cancellation, and the new charging case is worth the money in itself not to mention the other features it offers try to find them on sale, but get them they are is close to over the ear headphones you will get"
54,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Best headphones money can buy,So convenient. Blocks out all sound. Sound quality is awesome. This is my third pair.
55,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Had Bose before but this is much better with Apple phones,"The Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-quality pair of wireless earbuds with exceptional noise cancellation. Whether you are on the Long Island Rail Road or an airplane, the AirPods Pro's Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology can block out ambient noise, providing a more immersive listening experience. The Transparency mode also allows you to hear your surroundings when necessary, making them a safe option for use while commuting. Additionally, the AirPods Pro have a comfortable, ergonomic design that fits snugly in your ear, and the sound quality is superb. Overall, the Apple AirPods are an excellent investment for those who value noise cancellation and high-quality audio."
56,"May 2, 2023",3.0,One of the seals was missing,When I got the box I saw that one of the seals was missing but other than that the AirPods work just fine
57,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Gift for husband,Husband loves this.Really likes the noise cancellation
58,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Apple air pods,Amazon has the best price! This is the family‚Äôs 3rd pair purchased and we love them!
59,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Perfection!,I‚Äôve bought lower priced buds and always come away disappointed. Battery life could be better but everything else is 5 stars!
60,"May 2, 2023",3.0,"Form over function again, not worth the premium for how long they'll last","The sound quality is good, but you can't control the volume well at low ends--the quietest setting is still too loud for studying in quiet environments, and they've removed the options for adjusting sound globally because now iOS only lets you control the *loudest* sounds.So quiet listening is out.And they FALL OUT a lot. Worse balance than the original air pods. So stupid to not put in a little soft hook and design the case to accomodate that. They won't last because you're gonna lose them when they fall out."
61,"May 2, 2023",5.0,Music,As a music lover I fell in love with this and if you love music you need these there light weight and easy to use they fit so well in my ears and offer hours of the finest quality musical enjoyment
62,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Great,I mean they‚Äôre AirPods. What u expect is what ur getting so they great
63,"May 1, 2023",1.0,Lasted less than 90 days,"I got these for my son‚Äôs 15th bday and he loved them‚Ä¶for the 75 days they worked. Now, they no longer charge and we‚Äôve tried everything to fix. Since the purchase was made through Amazon, there‚Äôs no warranty that I‚Äôm aware of so I‚Äôm guessing this was a $200 waste."
64,"May 1, 2023",5.0,AAAAAAA,"Definitivamente es lo mejor del mercado, si realmente quieres cancelaci√≥n de ruido externo, c√≥mpralos, no busques mas."
65,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Great,Works and sounds how it should
66,"May 1, 2023",5.0,They just work,"The noise cancellation is excellent. The ambient sound is even better! They work so well switching back and forth between my various Apple products. These are the most satisfying to use apple items in a long time! Oh, and audio ain‚Äôt bad either!"
67,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Noise control for golfers!,"This noise control feature I found it really helpful if you want to block out some of the serious distractions on the golf course. Yes, even people talking or shouting at you. I highly recommend these. Great sounds and great features with nice modern look. Worth the investment."
68,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Definitely worth the money,I LOVE my AirPods pro 2. I could kick myself for not purchasing them sooner. I‚Äôm wearing them everyday for music & phone calls. This particular AirPods version has phenomenal noise canceling. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it could be this good. I was wearing them at work without the music on - just noise canceling and literally did not hear my office phone ring a mere 18 inches from me! They are definitely worth the money if you listen to music every day like I do .
69,"May 1, 2023",4.0,"Battery drains while idle, sounds great!","Love the sound and the cancelling capability! But I‚Äôve found that if they sit idle for very long the battery begins to drain, previous model wasn‚Äôt this thirsty. Overall am pretty happy and these stay in my ear better."
70,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Noise cancellation and quality,"Excellent product, easy to use, the noise cancellation is incredible, excellent battery and they fit very snug in the ear."
71,"May 1, 2023",2.0,Interference ruins the experience,"I am a huge Apple fan. I bought the latest AirPod Pro 2nd generation hoping to solve the interference and static I was experiencing with my 1st generation air pods. It may be related to the immediate area's RF (radio frequency). They could make these expensive AirPods resistant to environmental RF interference. Sometimes they work great‚Äîother times, brief static and interference. I went back to using the wired earbuds. Please comment below if you have had the same issue and can recommend a non-Apple wireless pair of earbuds."
72,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Perfect,Perfect
73,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Sound Quality,I like everything about my iPod pros. Sound quality is great and noise cancellation is excellent. Great for traveling and zoom meetings.
74,"May 1, 2023",5.0,amazing. just like i got them from best buy the first time i had them,"i love the airpods pro i‚Äôm a huge fan of these, i had a pair and they got stolen and i wanted another pair really bad. the noise cancelling is really good, the bass the sound quality, they are really good and unlike the regular airpods, they don‚Äôt leak so much sound leaving others around you distracted and annoyed. overall recommend, they came in the mail and i opened them up just like i did buying them from best buy all sealed up and everything. 10/10 recommend."
75,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Great upgrade from Gen 1 Pro's,"I like the upgrades for the Gen2 Airpod Pro's. The case has speakers, so if you lose the case you can use the Find My feature and it's actually pretty loud. The sound is great still, I honestly cannot tell much difference if any from the Gen 1's. I think the battery life is improved though, so you won't have to charge them as frequently."
76,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Perfect,Noice cancelling and sound quality are just perfect. There are also many handy features in it
77,"May 1, 2023",5.0,best in the industry.,On my 2nd set because my daughter put one in her mouth and caused sound distortion in my original set. Other than your children munching on these they are better than bose or beats in my opinion.
78,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Great AirPods!,"I love it! It has awesome sound quality and three modes! I love the Noice Cancellation, and I can put it on anytime when there‚Äôs loud sounds around me. I‚Äôm sensitive to loud sounds so it‚Äôs perfect for me! 10/10"
79,"May 1, 2023",5.0,Item as described arrived quickly,"Arrived a day ahead of expected delivery date, boxed nicely to limit damage. Bought on sale for 199, worth it, better than the other versions"
80,"April 30, 2023",5.0,As advertised,Works great
81,"April 30, 2023",5.0,It was delivered on time,So for I love everything about my ears phone
82,"April 30, 2023",2.0,Wind Noise Terrible vs Gen 1,"Expected much improved performance vs. Gen 1 but wind noise (such as while riding a bike) is much worse. Found sound quality and noise cancellation improved (except wind noise). The wind noise is so much worse than Gen 1 the air pods are almost useless while riding a bike. Called Apple for help (they are usually great) but seems like they are in denial on this issue. An internet search revealed numerous complaints similar to mine. This is a major tarnish on Apple's reputation in my mind..... especially the lack of help. I do recall Bose having an issue with their sleep buds and they admitted the problem, offered refunds and eventually launched an improved product. Don't understand why Apple will not admit their problem"
83,"April 30, 2023",5.0,Best air pods,Great and light weight and affordable
84,"April 30, 2023",5.0,"Insane Sound, Quiet Background","Don't look for other earbuds. Seriously. I have tried every pair of earbuds Apple has made. I have also tried Sony's latest headphones that are ""industry leading,"" as well as a pair of Bose's headphones with ANC. These are either the same or better than all of those products. The sheer amount of features and unexpected quirks and the flow of UI on my phone make it worth the buy. You might think 200 dollars is expensive for earbuds, and I will say it is. But if you are looking for high-end sound in a comfortable earbud, then this is it. I will say that the battery life is slightly worse than I expected for the price. I wished they would last slightly longer. As of right now with use of like 12 hours every two days I am charging them about twice a week. Best wireless earbuds ever."
85,"April 30, 2023",5.0,NOT FAKE!,Very nice and loud if you want spatial audio you have to go to accessibility scroll down to audio/visual and if you have mono audio take it off the turn on spatial audio and it basically sounds like the music is following you if you turn your head left you hear it in your left if you turn your head right you hear it in your right. But overall very good and not fake.Also of you would like to check if it is fake go to checkcoverage.apple.com and type in the serial number and if it pops up your airpods it isnt fake and if it pop up a error sign it is fake
86,"April 30, 2023",5.0,Wife loves them,"Bought these for my wife who regularly complains about, well, a lot of stuff, but specifically the discomfort she has with most in ear speakers. The over the ear are, apparently, not acceptable as they mess with the hair. These are the first pair of ear buds she has actually used regularly. Wish I‚Äôd bought them sooner."
87,"April 30, 2023",5.0,Whats expected from Apple,"Excellent quality in minimal space. New ones are slightly better than Gen1. Liked new and enhanced noise reduction, vol controls on earbuds are tricky to use though. Still smallest one with best features in comparison to rivals Bose, Sony etc which I used all. Especially Bose was awful and probably shameful product with lots of software glitches and battery life (box and earphones battery was dying itself if not used within a week max)."
88,"April 30, 2023",1.0,Poor sound quality,"Since day one my son‚Äôs AirPods Pro microphone sound quality has been bad. The mic picks up tons of background noise and the audio is often garbled. To be fair, Apple support has been okay. The Genius Bar tried to help and even replaced the AirPods, but it did not help. Perhaps it‚Äôs the phone itself, an iPhone 11, and not the AirPods, but regardless, they are are virtually useless for phone conversations."
89,"April 30, 2023",3.0,Has color transferred from jeans pocket,"I always carried onn airpods in the same pocket never had color mark from jeans pocket, but this 200$ apple airpod case has blue mark from the same jeans pocket i am dissapointed that apple quality seems like less than onn case quality to me"
90,"April 30, 2023",5.0,Great,"Fits perfect, noise cancellation and high quality. I like it."
91,"April 30, 2023",4.0,Yes and no,"The noise cancellation was good. The sound quality was good. The ear tip size, even with special replacement tips, wasn't good. They made my ears hurt, so I had to return them and buy the regular, non-pro AirPod version."
92,"April 30, 2023",3.0,Works as advertised,They‚Äôre okay. Still uncomfortable and painful in my ears after two months. Ear canals get sweaty too. But I‚Äôm the coolest guy on the block with my dope airpods
93,"April 30, 2023",5.0,Airbuds,I love them!!!
94,"April 30, 2023",3.0,"Defective, slow support","Within five minutes of trying them on for the first time, the right earbud started making a loud hissing, squealing sound. This would come and go. They were perfect for a 2.5 hour flight. But after about two weeks, they were doing this after just a couple of minutes.It took 45 minutes with Apple support before they agreed that maybe they should take them back for ""repair"" and another 25 minutes to work out the return. Not to mention my time to drive them to a UPS Store, where the entire concept of returning Apple products seemed new to them. By comparison, I contacted support for my 3D printer recently and it took them 3 minutes to diagnose my problem and ship me a replacement part.I suppose I would have been better off with an appointment at an Apple store, but I was afraid they would work perfectly in the store (this seems to happen more in quiet locations)."
95,"April 30, 2023",2.0,N,It has Manu scratches as of it had aletearte been used
96,"April 29, 2023",5.0,Incredible well balanced sound!!! Buy them!!!,"Noise cancelling is amazing for such a small device! Integration w apple ecosystem is incredible! Bass is strong but well balanced, I am simply amazed by these things!!! Tried Beats Fit Pro and they absolutely suck compared to these!"
97,"April 29, 2023",5.0,Awestruck,I don‚Äôt know if it is particular to these EarPods but the noise cancelling feature is jaw dropping. I seriously couldn‚Äôt believe my ears. Technology is amazing. Would do this purchase 10 times over.
98,"April 29, 2023",1.0,Do not buy,Mine have had consistent issues since purchasing. This is my 3rd pair but the only I‚Äôve bought from Amazon and this is the only pair having issues. Box will not stay charged and will not recognize when the ear buds are in place.
