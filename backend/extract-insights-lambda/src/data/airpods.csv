6,"October 7, 2020",5.0,Great earbuds,"  Purchased AirPods for my wife, she really likes them a lot and I got them at a great price thanks to Amazon Warehouse.  The sound quality is adequate for the design, depending on the sound quality you are looking for may want to step up to the pro model or check out the Powerbeat Pros as an alternative.  Overall we are happy with the purchase."
