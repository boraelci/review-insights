"13","December 30, 2022","4.0","Best on the market","Not much to say here: it's easy to use - just toss three in the laundry for a larger load and you're ready to go. If you find that it doesn't dissolve completely, one method would be to put in the pods first instead of putting it in after your laundry. I find that this method is the ""cleanest"" and ensure efficiency."
"14","December 26, 2022","5.0","These get the funk out.","If you do a lot of sweating at the gym or any type of sport and your clothes get a little funky this will take care of them. One scoop of OxiClean Odorblasters and this works amazing."
